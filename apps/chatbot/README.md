> NOT FINISHED:  Just getting setup for a our wrapup class.

This section highlights that the topics that we have been covering in class can come together in the form of a product, like a chatbot.

- Tokenization and text parsing
- Entity extraction
- intent classification

rasa extends these ideas and uses machine learning and neural networks to orchestrate the chatbot and serve the bot via an API. Moreover, the bot can be plugged into a number of existing services like Slack, Facebook Messenger and WhatsAapp!
