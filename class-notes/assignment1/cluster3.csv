Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,    music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far    exceed their technical skills.    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar    representions, a confounded user asks: ""What does it all mean?""    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for    composing imagery for understanding.    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the    computer graphics context.

1281,"News-Software: UReply 3.1X-X-From: Wingert@VNET.IBM.com (Bret Wingert)            <C5uBn5.tz@zoo.toronto.edu> ========================================================================A couple of points on this thread.1. We have been using our processes since way before Challenger.  Challenger   in and of it self did not uncover flaws.2. What Mr. Spencer says is by and large true.  We have a process that is   not dependent on ""sophisticated tools""  (CASE tools?).  However, tools   cannot fix a bad process.  Also, tool support for HAL/S (the Shuttle   Language) is somewhat limited.3. The Onboard Flight Software project was rated ""Level 5"" by a NASA team.   This group generates 20-40 KSLOCs of verified code per year for NASA.4. Feel free to call me if you or your organization is interested in more info   on our software development process.Bret Wingert(713)-282-7534FAX: (713)-282-8077Bret Wingert"

There are few methodsto protect both buyer and seller in any sort of transaction. Even withmerchants and customers there are problems...stolen credit cards, chargebacks, no return policies and getting the wrong item, etc.About the only protection available to to do business with someone youtrust....someone who has been around for a while.Jeff________________________________________________________________________"

Is this just a meaningless administrativeshuffle, or does this bode ill for SEI?In my opinion, this seems like a Bad Thing, at least on the surface.Griffin seemed to be someone who was actually interested in gettingthings done, and who was willing to look an innovative approaches togetting things done faster, better, and cheaper.  It's unclear to mewhether he will be able to do this at his new position.Does anyone know what his new duties will be?--_______________________________________________________________________________"
