8,"Interesting! One of our German friends here (Robert?) told me their forwardswere all Canadian-Germans. Perhaps somebody can sort this out for us? OK, ""this ain't North America"" and so on, but I still doubt that _any_ cityhaving a pop. of 500,000 and below could support an NHL team. Of course,Switzerland probably should be judged as one large city because of smalldistances between cities but still. Dusseldorf? YES, although the arena is an anachronism (an OPEN wall behind oneof the goals - essentially an outdoor arena!). Cologne's arena only seats about7,000-8,000, Berlin is about 6,000 and no new facility will be builtunless their Olympic bid is successful. Munich does have an arena. Malmo is big enough, but they also need a new arena...the current one has 5,000 seats I think.If we're talking about the NHL, even Helsinki would struggle to make it work.Turku (despite an excellent arena) and Tampere are nowhere near big enough formajor league hockey....Rome and the south are out of the question; this could as well be Africato hockey fans. Romans were given the chance to host some WC'94 games butshowed no interest whatsoever. All teams in the Italian league come from Milanand the smaller cities in the north.Paris had their own ""Volans Francais""(sp) pro team a couple of years ago.I believe they even made it to the European Club Championship finals tournament one year, but eventually folded due to lower-than-hoped-for attendances. The remaining cities seem to be too small to support a minor sport like hockey.The easter cities lack the money and infrastructure to support pro hockey.Perhaps . . . Most European teams will have to be like the Tampa Bay Lightninganyway; playing in a small 10,000 seat arena, backed by Japanese money, run by enthusiasts (Phil Esposito), heavymarketing, fans that have difficulty telling what ""icing"" means... London hasbeen mentioned, Sheffield and Birmingham also have large arenas and a newmega-facility (16,000 seats!) might be built in Bristol in a couple of years.No facilities to speak of; their biggest arena (in Eindhoven) seats 2,500 fans for hockey.

13,"The front covers should be available from Sony.  Check with a local carstereo shop.  You will probably (definitely) have to provide the units serial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card.  I don't know the cost, but replacements have to be available to peoplewho damage the face cover, so it stands to reason that it can be replaced.As to deterring theft:When I worked for a stereo shop, we referred the customer to a Sony 800number.  We would not sell the face, nor did we have them available.  Mostpeople who came in asking for the face cover (or a pullout sleave for thatmatter) would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deckthey couldn't use.

14,"The company was probably ""Public Missiles, Inc"" of Michigan.Yup.Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to beone of the following:a) An employee of a government agency.b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved inresearch or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in constructionand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on thelocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraftwithin the operating radius around the launch site.- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace thatunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over thewestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popularsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members'use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback isfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an ""F"" motor are exempt frommost Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, SubpartC, for details.As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typicalrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carryeither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launchesin the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rocketsfor information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everythingbigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is topractice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbstakeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESEROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggestmisconceptions people have about our hobby. True. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get hit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand. "

As far as we know it has no > materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids > and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low > grade fusion reactors.I don't know what a ""low grade"" fusion reactor is, but the majorproblem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusionreactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just sosmall -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in somefractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith wouldhave to be processed.This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moonas a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn'tcontent with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust,average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though themarket price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound.This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; ""high-Ti"" basalts (Apollo 11and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but...terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched intitanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, andsometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over theworld (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  Ifeven 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Tibasalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the mooncould be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of theore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores beingmined today)."

26,"Any lunar satellite needs fuel to do regular orbit corrections, and whenits fuel runs out it will crash within months.  The orbits of the Apollomotherships changed noticeably during lunar missions lasting only a fewdays.  It is *possible* that there are stable orbits here and there --the Moon's gravitational field is poorly mapped -- but we know of none.Perturbations from Sun and Earth are relatively minor issues at lowaltitudes.  The big problem is that the Moon's own gravitational fieldis quite lumpy due to the irregular distribution of mass within the Moon."

If someone responds, I will repost it when I get it; otherwise, I willre-write it in a day or two and post it.  Sorry about that.#8	LARRY DEPALMA		Season:	3rdAcquired:	'91-92, free agent from MinnesotaGrade:		I (C-/D+)No netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was atthe end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but hewasn't in San Jose, he wasn't in Kansas City, and his name hasn't appeared onthe waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most partfor DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,DePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing gooddefense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest ofthe way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally lookedlethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down toKansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstatedwhen it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared fromthe watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharksofficials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.#10	JOHAN GARPENLOV		Season: 3rdAcquired:	'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round		pick in '92 entry draft from VancouverGrade:		A/A-After an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the restof the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on theteam, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing RobGaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second inthe MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as hewas seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to himby putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-play goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despitehis small size (5' 11"", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself aroundwhen necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to workon his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, andwas actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He willbe a major key to the offense next year.#15	DAVID BRUCE		Season: 5thAcquired:	'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draftGrade:		I (?)After a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) andwas third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was botheredvirtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of thelineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult tospeculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected bythe injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a manshort in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensiveleader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, hisfuture with the Sharks next season appears clouded.#18	MARK PEDERSON		Season:	3rdAcquired:	'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave SnuggerudGrade:		I (B)It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson,after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), butafter riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to theSharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited byinjuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But whenhealthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size(and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered aphysical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liabilityon defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see howmuch, exactly, Pederson can do.#20	JOHN CARTER		Season: 4thAcquired:	'91-92, free agent from BostonGrade:		I (B+/B)Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hardwork worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although hedid look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work cando, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, alwayshussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensivezone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impressoffensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  Heis very unlikely to be back next season.#28	JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN	Season: 1stAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:		I (B+/B)I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creatingopportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHLduty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in trainingcamp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer inexhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with theSharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be asolid contender for regular duty next season.#41	MARK BEAUFAIT		Season: 1stAcquired:	2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draftGrade:		I (?)After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with theSharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and theSharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his onlyNHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9"", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shyto throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,although it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he playedmostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan andKansas City.#42	JAROSLAV OTEVREL	Season: 1stAcquired:	8th round pick in 1991 entry draftGrade:		I (?)Like Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he wasup for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generallyvery much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once hisdefense is acceptable, he should be ready.#44	MICHEL PICARD		Season: 1stAcquired:	'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon CorriveauGrade:		I (B-/C+)The 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems tobe close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by theSharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals forhis only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.He was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensivebrilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, althoughhe has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in theexpansion draft.#45	DODY WOOD		Season: 1stAcquired:	3rd round pick in 1991 entry draftGrade:		I (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probablyno surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, wasnot particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losingmany fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs atleast another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, ifnothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11"", 181 lbs.) does not give muchpossibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer."

59,I am interested in a 2d/3d graphics library which will allow our designteam to write graphics software for Unix workstations and be as portable as possible.  Eventually this software will have to be moved to MicrosoftWindows.  It is my opinion that a good API with hooks to PEX underneathwould prove most portable.Does anyone out there have any experience with Figaro+ form TGS orHOOPS from Ithaca Software?  I would appreciate any comments.- Claye Hart

67,"Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode(probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar notspent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft.  In order to turn thespacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will beavailable, or you need to retrain a new team.Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed.Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set.Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a ""standby"" mode foruse in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is stillrequired to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance isrelatively cheap.Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenanceto stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin-stabilized control mode because it would require little power or maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from timeto time.In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money),but there is some technical rationale behind the decision."

Watch them in the offensive zone, especially on the powerplay. Damphousse or Lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone, maybe pass to thepoint, get it back, skate some more, pass it around....BUT WHERE'S THE SHOT??!Answer: the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who standsin front of the net a la` Neely, Shanahan, Tocchet, etc etc.  Too bad Demers won't put Dipietro or LeClair on the powerplay more often.  Dammit,even Ewen would at least cause some disruptions.  Montreal desperately needsa power forward with some talent, IMO.Then watch them in their own zone. Patrick Roy is screened on everything. Saywhat you want about his performance; IMNSHO he cannot stop what he cannot see. And Montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net. Last night against Washington Roy played a *great* game.  The first goal cameon the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble I've seen in a long time, and hedidn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot.  The second goal came on adeflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway.  Pathetic defence.  Thethird goal was EN.No wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen."

84,"This algorithm works well for me:Algorithm to attempt to find outward-facing normals:---------------------------------------------------First, mark all faces as UNKNOWN.Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of thefaces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representingthe two shared vertices).Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.  Using the edgedictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation ofthis face.  And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistentlyorienting the entire surface.Find the average of the vertices in this surface.  Using that point,calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face'sorientation.  If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the facesare oriented correctly.  If it is negative, reverse their orientations(mark them CLOCKWISE).If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another faceand go through the algorithm again.At the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversedbefore facet normals are found.(Note: if you are running on Silicon Graphics machines and buy theIRIS Inventor 3D toolkit developers package you have the source tothis algorithm-- see /usr/src/Inventor/tools/ivnorm/.

The intersection of 3 planes methodlooks best, but my implementation based on a short article in Graphics Gems I doesn't work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course.I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favorof dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In eithercase a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solutionof linear equations).To get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say,P1 to P2, and setting the normal as the ""normalized"" vector from P1 to P2.These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resultingcenter point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points(for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks likeI need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, whichwill require bringing in another routine I don't have (but should be easy tofind).Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 setsof 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also definethe circle center.  However, small numerical imprecisions would make thelines not intersect.

121,"To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota:  From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people in the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St. Paul ""Pioneer Press"" wrote an article giving the ""inside scoop"" on the issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic Center (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty confident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will ultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name) believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, because of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  However, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to this mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future viability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even further.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would bebe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, which may happen.	Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are Hartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota ""Ice Demons?"") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in as many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see Hartford and Tampa show up there either.	So, Minnesota may end up getting another team, but it may take a few years.		Go Sabres!"

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS    Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints    have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on    microfilm.    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch    from.    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean    sheet design.    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being    ""scooped"" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently    releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early    in a mission.    RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES    There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to    block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium    thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

Hanson, editor; DOE Document No.  DOE/TIC-22800;    Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., April 1980.)    IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER    From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from    the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible    for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted    study, Charles Jackman.    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year	  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year	  Shuttle sources:	  725,000 kilograms/year    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the    total stratospheric chlorine sources.    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons    do at the present time.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE    If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a    minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to    watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly ""the bends"", certainly some    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,    you're dying. The limits are not really known.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin    team's medical/forensic report.    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT    You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit    because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly    specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit    spacecraft.    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]    THE ""FACE ON MARS""    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't    know the address) to study the Face.    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or    sci.astro.    V. DiPeitro and G.

142,"     What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution,crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution.   Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are   quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?   Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?   Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought thegamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected thatGRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population(within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactichalo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed)(also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster wasprobably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)	As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halopopulation should show anisotropy (a local disk population isruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy youhave to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanismof getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should startto see for example the Andromeda's bursters.	The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution(but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source withthe right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (henceisotropy) and the edge is ""the edge of the Universe"" ;-)If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect)and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron starcolliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then gettingthe spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.	If we know anything about physics at that level,the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmicstrings, wrong spectrum for one thing.The situation is further complicated by recent claims thatthere are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NSthey'd actually probably fit relatively easily into theNS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]   my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering   hyperspace :-)   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.If you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm..."

Mitchell                          March 23, 1993 INTRODUCTION: In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, areal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to testtele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individualslocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainmentpurposes.Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation andtele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing ofinformationon methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout ofalunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminatingeducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity andachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate inTwenty-First century remote learning methods. Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interestsandskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,interfacingand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolvingplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students andprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal ata participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models attheLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a realfacilityexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of theconstructionof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggestedby the users themselves. This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups: - tele-operations and virtual reality research - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers - art and theater - bbs and online network users - software and game developers - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains - children - the child in all of us LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN: A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are usedfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.The ""floor"" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributionsis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design andcreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, andmachine-lets.  The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets: 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land; 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.  Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals. The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trainswith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and controlelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user willreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of theirdata link to LTM1. Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from aservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for theSSTOto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunarlandscape and land. Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equippedbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operatorsworldwideto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing andtakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based oncommerciallyavailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for theinterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advancedham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers. By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and addinga tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can beprovided in under 80 man hours. PLAN OF ACTION: The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project byproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual constructionof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can bemodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide ""rail stock""for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphicalcommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.An initial ""ground breaking"" with miniature shovels will be performed fora live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initialmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started forhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completelyserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additionalbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present andthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distributionworld-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will beissuedcalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scalemodelsfor the simulated lunar colony. A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will thenbeannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being tofind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects ofthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at thattimethe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors willthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they returntotheir campus. A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and viaconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipmentaddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photoopportunity for the television community. Especially since the ""action""willbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will beinvited to issue ""challenges"" to engineering and human factors students atuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to performlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may besimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges. The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,experimentationand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being alongterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the genericexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limitedto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which canlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars! CONCLUSION: EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who hasever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of aglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentationpurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only createworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that requirereal(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds inspace.

149,"------- Blind-Carbon-CopyTo: spacenews@austen.rand.org, cti@austen.rand.orgSubject: White House outlines options for station, Russian cooperationDate: Tue, 06 Apr 93 16:00:21 PDTFrom: Richard Buenneke <buenneke@austen.rand.org>4/06/93:  GIBBONS OUTLINES SPACE STATION REDESIGN GUIDANCENASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.April 6, 1993RELEASE:  93-64        Dr.  John H.  Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and TechnologyPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on theRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidanceto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the spacestation.        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and ahigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Eachoption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscalyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, researchoperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate programreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASAbudget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result,station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsettingreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space stationoption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASAbudget over the next 5 years.        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session ofthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused uponadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They alsoreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process theStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisorycommittee to consider.        Gibbons also announced that the United States and itsinternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- havedecided, after consultation, to give ""full consideration"" to use ofRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in theredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesignteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIRand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise ofthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  Theoverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducingstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achievingthat goal.        Gibbons reiterated that, ""President Clinton is committed to theredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve thescience, the technology and the jobs that the space station programrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is wellmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which shouldbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.""        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russianparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space ScienceCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of RoaldSagdeev."

151,"As the Sharks' season came to a close tonight, I will start a series of posts,trying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went throughfor the Sharks for the past season.  If you are uninterested, since I willhave the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you cankill them.I will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course,are subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective aspossible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharksand/or did not play for another NHL team this season.Thus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...#1	BRIAN HAYWARD		Season:	11thAcquired:	'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:		P (D)It is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career thatfeatured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passinggrade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice thisyear, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he wouldnot be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.But Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' firstever victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.As he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.#30	JEFF HACKETT		Season: 3rdAcquired:	'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draftGrade:		CHackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simplywasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,almost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% savepercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie tobench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carrythe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an earlyinjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,but upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return nextyear.#31	WADE FLAHERTY		Season: 1st (still eligible as rookie)Acquired:	'91-92, signed as undrafted free agentGrade:		I (A-)It is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus theincomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the CalgaryFlames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He startedthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'owner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVPhonors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as hetries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for ArtursIrbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking upall-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he canshare the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, TrevorRobins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, hemay not ever.#32	ARTURS IRBE		Season:	1stAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:		B+I may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established thathe's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He hasprovided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, gettingthe team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.He has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck andmaking passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, thegoonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to dowith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge fora playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being namedas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts."

Best strategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E.Taylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45,when the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to selland will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.     Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on; what's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).Others can add on their opinions as well."
154,"Hi,    I was reading through ""The Spaceflight Handbook"" and somewhere inthere the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on themwhen and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close tothe sun in a hyperbolic orbit. The magnitude of such accelerations heestimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may notbe a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was publishedin 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is verylong-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations infact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices ofcourse. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration?Can this be extended to larger accelerations?"

It is like me telling you that Felix Potvin isn't very good because a team would be better if the had Lemieux instead ofhim.  Sure Lemieux is a better player, but he is a different type ofplayer.  For a team to be successful, they need to have all types ofplayers- this includes defensive forwards.When compared with other defensive forwards, Bob Gainey is the greatestdefensive forward ever.  He is the player who's talents best suited beinga defensive forward- who completely dominated the game when he played.Maybe if a more talented player such as Gretzky had decided to waste hisoffensive talents and play defensively, he could have been a betterdefensive forward, but he wasn't.Bob Gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey."

Inthis method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection pointof the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd,then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases whichmay make you headache.The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point andall the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of thesuccessive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, thenit is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.My experience tells the second method is relible.Hope this helps."

203,"About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared tobe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering ifanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published solutions to it.	The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by tworoughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentiallystarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extantbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw the object we 1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively	computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume	that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not	exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable	measure.2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment	of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two	triangles which will be filled in to color the surface.3) Depth sort the triangles4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw	and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is	along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge	colored with a special ""edge color""	It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of theproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps inthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.They involve both rasterization problems and problems resultingfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problemsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in thisarea."
204,"Golly, I love stupid people. :-)Listen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,there exist these things called ""ties"".  A tie occurs when a game endswith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. There also exits these things called ""wins"".  A win is when one team has ahigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each otherat a time, so I can say ""the opponent"".)  A team gets two points for awin.  So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10ties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  Thefirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86points.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the numberof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.  So,Rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, thenthat's what it means.  In our example, the second team would win thetiebreaker and therefore have the ""better"" record, even though both teamshad the same number of points.  If you didn't understand this post, Rex,maybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly.:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)--    Keith Keller				LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!

214,"My votes (FWIW):Team MVP: Pat Verbeek. He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has 36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captainthroughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos andMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category thanMVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player onthe team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guessI place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.Biggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last seasonas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all comingfrom the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: AndrewCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, andPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed therole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yakebounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will putup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, startedperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to theright side.Biggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77point season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen startedthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commandedthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked hisway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years leftto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subparafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes ofcompetence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much betterhockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who onlyseemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he gotto make a number of starts in a row."

217,"Two developments have brought these type of activities back tothe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed fromthe Mir Space Station.  While this ""Banner"" reflector was blank,NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Bannerreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TVcommercial, as filmed from the Mir.   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, thesame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestogabooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the ""EnvironmentalBillboard"".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of theUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of theLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the ""EnvironmentalBillboard"" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,deployed by the inflatable 'frame'.   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible formaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry ""ozone readingsensors"" to ""continuously monitor the condition of the Earth'sdelicate protective ozone layer,"" according to Mike Lawson, head ofSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimumexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth'satmosphere. According to IMI, ""as the biodegradable material burns,it will release ozone-building components that will literallyreplenish the ozone layer."" The remaining spacecraft will monitorthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burnsup and ""adds to the ozone supply.""   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least severalmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMIestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people whowatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is beingpromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996Summer Olympics in Atlanta.  But back to Brian's questions:      See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (myestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus$10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming totailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times foroptimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back uponsomeone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicatedlaunch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this aswell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the useof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think thelegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,and no, I don't really like the idea of this additional lightpollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legalchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positiveaspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make theadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would changepositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate thespace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like anidiot?)   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a lowenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it wouldonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and beforedawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible justafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the timeof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might stillbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  Therewere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestogaadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was foronly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious fundingfor this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around lookingfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But Iam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.     And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please bemy guest.

251,"In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such aproject.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or inhassles.The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting tothe Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practicallydown in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses anynew problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km --the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course,you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyunsand beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (formore than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit.For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can developa new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clippermight be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are lessambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doingsustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wastingmoney in a big way.Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* aminor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, whichdominates the cost of the project."

263,"-------------------------------------	+ ............The OTIS Project '93  +      	+ ""The Operative Term Is STIMULATE"" + 	-------------------------------------	---this file last updated..4-21-93---WHAT IS OTIS?OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artworkand photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,    and distribution.  Digital immortality.The basic idea behind ""digital immortality"" is that computer networks   are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on themwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be theartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in differentformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll bethere...and someone will dig them up.   If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critiqueand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closesand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hangas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons. Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your owncopies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption...that's what they're here for.---------------------------------------------------------------WHERE?             OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.    	141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site			sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite 	(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)Merely ""anonymous FTP"" to either site on Internet and change to theappropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the ""bin""command to make sure you're in binary.OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around NorthAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply ofOTIStuff...	Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines	CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron-------------------------------------------------------------- HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?              What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-putit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated worksare also welcome.OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bittougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    JPG files to a standard GIF format. OTIS also accepts animation files.      When you submit image files, please send me email at the same timestating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to beused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for peopleto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'llbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of emailing).If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely sendcopies to:The OTIS Projectc/o Ed StastnyPO BX 241113Omaha, NE 68124-1113I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line description of the image that we can include in the infofile in thedirectory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to whatthe images are to be named, include those as well.   Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, pleasecontact me and we'll arrange things.If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5""disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP,but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBMcompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF orJPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rathernot have to.At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as theycan stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can senda blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to get a slab-o-OTIS.As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  Email me for current archive size and directory.--------------------------------------------------------------------DISTRIBUTION?The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it isnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format toanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport theappropriate text files along with the images.   It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post imagesfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them soparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much aspossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favoriteBBS system....or even just post this ""info-file"" there.  It would bekeen of you.--------------------------------------------------------------------USE?If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, orfull address credit).  You will either find this in the "".rm"" file for    the image or series of images...or in the ""Artists"" directory under the Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, emailme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for you, or give you their contact information. When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artistknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some suchcompensation for their files.---------------------------------------------------------------------NAMING IMAGES?Please keep the names of your files in ""dos"" format.  That means, keepthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The wayI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three orfour digit ""code"" for the series of images, plus the series number.Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be somethinglike: 	ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETCKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename willremain intact on all systems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CREATING IMAGE FILES?When creating image files, be sure to at least include your namesomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference incase they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,address or other information you'd like people to know.-----------------------------------------------------------------------HMMM?!That's about it for now.  More ""guidelines"" will be added as needed.Your input is expected.-----------------------------------------------------------------------DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS   	     (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,	     or ezine administrator.

The files will go to the public at large.  	     It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone	     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.      	     Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS	     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights	     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to 	     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed 	     electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed     	     all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is	     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or	     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not 	     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        	     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific	     permission for this sort of usage.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------Remember, the operative term is ""stimulate"".

Make up yer mind, Fred!First, I try to address what I think you meant, for which I am rewardedwith a denial of sorts, and a smart remark.  Then, I point out that I amnot clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wronglyinterpreting you a second time, and I'm stupid for it.  I just can't win,can I, Fred?  You've got a great point here somewhere, it's just thatbetween stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding ofyour valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.*** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning ***Too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or youwould have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reasonto ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretationsthat you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults moremeaning than they ever should have had.My reading of what Nick actually said is that ""people aren't required inall parts of all space processes"", so your taking issue with his opinionsregarding people in the space program, I read as ""People are required inall parts of all space processes.""  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'mso patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eatyour terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto andstring models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)The point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'donly be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's yourjob, Fred.And, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points,simultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan'that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors thatyou do as much as anyone.No, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts madeyou imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even thoughit's no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone asdense as myself.Of course, Socrates.  How could it be otherwise?Who cares who came on the net first?  If you do, consider that you sawme come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years.If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I wentdown exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It'sjust amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that'sno worse than your own.Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical,while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and mycomplaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-callingisn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I mightsee it better, Fred.""Net.ghod wannabe""?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted mymotivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (asyour insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care aboutpeople that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was toimpress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on privatemail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such ajerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands.Alas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables andbringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuablepurpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I triedto make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried tocommunicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.Well, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I'll never be able to get a(nother) jobwith NASA, since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall.  Well,I just hope you're happy.  Please leave me alone, now.  I just don'thave the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me.

Yeah, not the makings of a hockey superstar, Iknow, but try to have a reason, any reason, to shoot him down.    Hey cowboy!

Do you have an argument, or doyou just like to throw around a few names hoping to impress us?   Great.  I couldn't agree more.  The Flyers won two cups for thesame reasons...deservedly so.  So what?

A good GM (like Murray) canmaintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level.In the history of hockey there have been several better GM's than Murray-way too many to name.  Murray isn't even the best GM in the league today.He fails in comparison to Sinden, Sather, Savard, Caron, Fletcher andQuinn in my estimation.I can't imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seenin hockey- unless they have seen VERY few GM's."

321,"All of this talk about a COMMERCIAL space race (i.e. $1G to the first 1-year moon base) is intriguing. Similar prizes have influenced aerospace development before. The $25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of Saint Louis venture to his financial backers.If memory serves, the $25k prize would not have been enough to totally reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects (such as Fokker's, Nungesser and other multi-engine projects).

Forproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage RocketTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How tolower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry forour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of atorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a newthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old thingsfrom past masters.     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so calledexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made nosense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president ofthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,""defies the best principles of launching payloads into space."" Well Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad!  What are theseprinciples that SSRT defies?     Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you needa giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the""fact"" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And itviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant forless than many billions of dollars.     It took some of the last generation's experts to teach ussome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not aSaturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years todemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remindus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was asenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of asingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's. Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build alittle, Test a little.     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  Wedidn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just changeevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- TheALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would betterknown as ""Shape Shifter"" than ""Space Lifter.""  We didn't spend alot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's thelast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn'ttake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted ofone very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by thethreat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair ifit ran over cost or schedule.     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind itsonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and stepsthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  Buteach step should follow the same principles -- a small managementteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modestbudget.     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:(See charts)     I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the lastgeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950'sand 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope thatcan't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least wecould do is soft-land on Earth!     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build alittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordableand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers amongyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermalprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to landhorizontally, etc, etc.     I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  Youbring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we dowhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.

Slo-mos sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really are. Besides, if Messier can't take the heat, he should stay out of the kitchen. Well Matt, Mattias Timmander hasn't been playing with the MoDo elite league team yet (just the MoDo junior team), so I predict he needs a few more years here before he can join the B's. I saw him play in the Swedish championship game for junior players this year, and he played very well, a physical game, but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does (I suspect you would like to have a Ulf type-of-player on the B's team too? :) As for Mariusz Czerkawski, he has had a *great* season for Hammarby in division 1. He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season, and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. Mariusz is Djurgarden property (he was just on loan to Hammarby), so he will play in Elitserien next season, unless the B's can get him of course. I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to watch in Swedish hockey this season. Staffan"

375,": : Of course, penalties will have to be changed:: : Roughing:	Chauvanistic Males Being Aggressive: Slashing:	Chauvanistic Males Venting Frustration: Fighting:	Proof That Males Cannot Cope With Their Feelings: NO NO NO! since all the penalties fall into three classes, there shouldonly be three penalties:1. Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you   are thrown out of the game, and fined.3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.Besides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penaltiesin a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,until the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was inthe act of shooting when the foul ocured.This works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the mostexciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.Next, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network cantake a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the networkannouncers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, andMarv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened beforethe PA announcer says it.Oh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the playcannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the networkcan sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has toldthem who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a chance of pronouncing his name right.Seriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,for the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play isso slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shootingcontests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their routines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periodseither. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. Thegame is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.The reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw incommercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.On TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watchit on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, thenit truly is a sad day.Enough for now."

384,"        Well, lets see....I took a class on this last fall, and I have nonotes so I'll try to wing it...          Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, takingappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so anyof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of thegalaxy.          Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from thevarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, eitherPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on ourcatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropicdistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs ofhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we aresampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, Isuppose you are saying, ""Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside thedisk.""  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less aninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay outto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors detect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane fromthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mileaway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of hisarbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybefind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.          I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As Isaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (shorttimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type ofbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be boundto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely seenot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none ofthese characteristics.  "

O'Connor is quoted saying whether it ispossible to cut costs that much and still provide formeaningful research ""is a real question for me.""O'Connor said ""everything is fair game,"" including""dropping or curtailing existing contracts with theaerospace industry, chopping management of the spacestation program at some NASA facilities around thecountry, working closely with the Russian space stationMir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement themanned space shuttle fleet.""O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design optionsso far, and they are sorting the serious candidatesinto three categories based on cost.The Post says O'Connor described the design derivedfrom the current SSF as a high cost option (I believeKathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. Ilistened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the presson Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connortalked about how the White House wants three options,sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another partof the briefing, he discussed the three teams he hasformed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single LaunchCore [""wingless Orbiter""] @ JSC. Later, in response toa reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor saythe option based on a SSF redesign was a ""moderate""cost option, in between low & high cost options. Notthe ""high cost"" option as Sawyer wrote).The article goes on to describe the other two optionsas ""one features modules that could gradually be fittedtogether in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. Theother is a core facility that could be deposited inorbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That optionwould use existing hardware from the space shuttle -the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure."""

432,"Let's start over.  I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'dtake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1netminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less thanthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their recordsare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel asthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.You say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very wellbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed inthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.But I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him playfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's justmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought thatabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'mbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.As for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by theoffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make thesave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn'tget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that'swhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force theshooter to beat him.I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh onopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defendingchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he wassenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that aMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that gameand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense arepart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.Anyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel andI'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, Idon't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me anytickets next season:-)."

As published in ""US Industrial Outlook 1993"" (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.    In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to $450 M, future sales will be ""adversely affected by the downward revision in Department of Defense launch plans.""                              Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very successful in regaining international market share in the satellite business.    Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually publishes a listing of  ""Space Business Indicators"" in mid-year, and the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.    Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive as currently projected.)    It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] 2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.    The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although details of the launch services contract were reported to be negotiation, and not yet final.    The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  Under this contract the USAF can also request ""launch on demand"" services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to occur within 40 days of the request.     [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping MDC as a viable commerical launch company.     However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.    Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III program in favor of the USAF NLS/""Spacelifter"" program.  At this time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and Congress propose cancellation of all ""ELV upgrade"" programs (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed ""Spacelifter"" program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]  3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC ""GO-AHEAD""   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral images of the Earth.    [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new venture as a ""Star Wars"" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable customers for this service include exploration geologists, agricultural planners, and urban planners.     It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.    There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote sensing ventures working their way through the system at different stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures appearing in the next year or so.]                  4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ ""STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT""    Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent analyst's report Morgan Stanley said ""We are more than ever convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical 95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-generating unit.""  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.    [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur program is back on track, this division will continue to show substantial losses.    In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of change for any company.]  5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade.    Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14 contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.    Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can compete are projected to come from communications satellites with the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.    Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with larger communications payloads carrying more transponders. Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to about 3000 kg in GEO.    Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing or near-term transponders.    One of the significant possible changes in the market was identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.    [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical transponders on orbit.   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability service, but only from established point A to established point B. To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable between the points, and while there are improved network solutions, installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost millions or billions of dollars.     For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic.    Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite launches over longer intervals.    And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it looks like the space transportation market will be rather over-supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.    We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launches.]6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT    The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation of range safety rules.     In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the valid abort call.    Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.    Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used in the launch.   [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.     At the time of writing this column, some of the initial investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four different communications channels were in use during the test. After the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the best set being that clear lines of communications and clear definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and understanding of the mission rules were not established before the launch.     As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they do with commercial aircraft problems).     I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how specific lines of authority should be delineated.] 7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the ""Aerokosmos"" winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the ""Severkosmos"", launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called 'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.    [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.    This one's a little different in that they are offering variants of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being targeted or substantial financial backing.]8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.    [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected returns were too low to justify the cost of development.     This might point out some key discriminators in judging the feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup costs?  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the investment?     Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush authorized space technology transfer for several joint space ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor launch vehicle as well as from the US.    [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on system).     This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to find any other European development work with even a rumor of funding for hardware.    Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.    What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lagged that of the propulsion system.    It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this contract.] 10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2 launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as ""the main alternative rocket supplier"" for the small satellite launch service to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the Swedish satellite was not specified.    [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series rockets are built of ""off the shelf"" components based upon the Lunar MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a 225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.     PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and 2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the board of directors.     PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.    The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real hardware.] 11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the satellite's communications channels.     [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 M) through 2006.     I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two separate sastellite ventures.    The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is ""Asiasat-2"", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing Hong Kong-based ""Asiasat"" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed.    In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This is just another indicator to add to the list.] 12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES   South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by 1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by 2000.                                    [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its national aerospace industry, specifically including space activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are coming into the commercial space market.    As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.    South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely ""made in Korea.""  Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-monitoring micro-satellite.    This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with optical and microwave sensors.   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel military effort to establish the capabilities for building and launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a government panel had been established to oversee such an effort, funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the Korean peninsula.          In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).     This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition of commercial space market there over the next decade.] 13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

451,"The HGA isn't all that reflective in the wavelengths that might ""cook thefocal elements"", nor is its figure good on those scales--the problem isthat the antenna _itself_ could not be exposed to Venus-level sunlight,lest like Icarus' wings it melt.  (I think it was glues and such, as wellas electronics, that they were worried about.)  Thus it had to remainfurled and the axis _always_ pointed near the sun, so that the smallsunshade at the tip of the antenna mast would shadow the folded HGA.(A larger sunshade beneath the antenna shielded the spacecraft bus.)"
453," (excerpts from posting on this topic) (I've seen satellites at midnight - they're not only in twilight.) :o) Now my comments: I'd like to add that some of the ""protests"" do not come from a strictly practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief in an afterlife.  The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains one weekend, ""getting away from it all"" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a lastbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. "

I bought another (a Canadian) at the beginning of the next season, and I still have it.  I also have an Easton, that a friend was getting rid off, after giving up the game.  I find that Easton blades are easier to get, but all brands of blades are pretty well interchangeable.  Watch out for dried up bits of firewood, that some stores pass off as blades.  In my experiences, the blades of an aluminum break more often than regular sticks, but I've only ever broken one aluminum shaft.I like aluminum sticks.  The blades are quickly changed, even on the bench if you have to.  On the downside, the shaft won't break if you decide to impale yourself on it :-)Ciao,Mark S."

507,"Actually, this part was really interesting.  It turns out that the mask iscustom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his/her face through apiece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the faceand forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plasticwrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, aplaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12minutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of thegoalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involvespadding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.  John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show. Yeah, Essensa's mask looked really good. Actually, I thought I heard him say that it _was_ Potvin's for certain.  Iwould bet money on it either way...and it did look awesome!"
509,"""Deeply rooted rivalry?"" Ahem, Jokerit have been around since 1967 and joinedthe top flight only in the early '70s. Helsingfors IFK have been around since1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I thinkyou're exagerating here.That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian &American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to ourset of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained aboutas much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, SeanBurke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs inthe NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been 3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembledfrom the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford or Tampa Bay currently are doing.---But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end upwith Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire andno Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:(28-30=superstar)(23-27=star)(18-22=NHL regular+)(13-17=NHL regular)( 8-12=role player)FINLAND:  D-Jyrki Lumme.......20D-Teppo Numminen....20D-Peter Ahola.......13C-Jari Kurri........25C-Christian Ruuttu..16R-Teemu Selanne.....27L-Esa Tikkanen......20(Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)SWEDEN:D-Ulf Samuelsson....21D-Fredrik Olausson..20D-Niklas Lidstrom...18D-Calle Johansson...18D-Kjell Samuelsson..17D-Tommy Sjodin......13D-Tommy Albelin......7C-Mats Sundin.......26C-Thomas Steen......18R-Thomas Sandstrom..22R-Ulf Dahlen........18R-Michael Nylander..13L-Per-Erik Eklund...18L-Johan Garpenlov...16L-Mikael Andersson..15L-Jan Erixon........14This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg'sSelanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York'sTikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. ButI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team didwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts ofMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There'spresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars atthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would bethat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.---Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 topplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely onSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as highas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the ""dynasty"" talkisn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have anadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumablyplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn theNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a couple of years the same way Edmonton's ""dynasty"" crumbled in the late '80s. Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, the amateur draft should be open to anyone. "

524,"little.I know what you mean!  I glow everytime Ronnie's out on the ice.In fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in personis that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probablybe seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.He said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dadstressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have tolearn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously tookthat advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrivedin Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn'tand wouldn't play a lick of defense.It's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that broughtall of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he hascertainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking atthis team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-uppermanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and itwouldn't matter.If I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they wouldbe 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.

(It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.)As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficultto do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:  - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out     of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own    breathing effort (let alone anything else)  - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is    expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled    is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough    gas per unit volume.   Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungsor interfere with their healing or anything like that... "
566,"1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes.--------------------------------Playoffs:---------*Stauber disturbed by third-man themeby Rick Sadowski, Daily NewsBarry Melrose's decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in thecrease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well withthe rookie goaltender.""I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the mostfun time of the year, and I'm not,""  Stauber said with some emotion Monday.  ""Ithink I have worked hard enough for that.""Stauber said he accepts Melrose's choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goaliein their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays6-3 opening victory.But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind RickKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down thestretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.Knickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.Yet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backupagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on OlympicSaddledome popcorn.""If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...Idropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?""  Stauber wondered.  ""Not that I'd behappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in theplayoffs.""Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is notconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.While insisting he is the Kings' ""goalie of the future,"" Melrose said Stauberflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,according to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the NewYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to Vancouver on Thursday.""Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he couldhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it,"" Melrose said.  ""Anelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of agreat goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.""""I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you'vegot to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everythingis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expectmore from him than he does.""Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when theteam hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signedoff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.""I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,"" said Stauber,a three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.""What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniateddisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously doexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.""""Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry doesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'ma perfectionist.""Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. ""But even though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's a bit of a jump,"" he said.  ""You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game you're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 and then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain to him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I do know is, it's a sport.

Theannouncer states ""well folks this game is getting out of hand. Lets go tothe Islander/Capitals game."" I celebrate as I was actually making progress inmy CS homework because I was so bored by the scheduled game.  I tear down andthrow on my jersey, Hunter scores I go ape shit 'cause this is the firstcaps game I've been able to watch all season. And what does ESPN do? theygo back to the blowout that NJ hasn't a chance in hell of winning!     The period ends and the sportscaster (CAPITOLS JUST TIED IT UP!! YES!!oops excuse me =) goes into his penguin worship mode (Dont freak pens fans!They are worthy of this! I'm so glad we wont have to play them as much nextyear!) and here comes the 3rd period...what? its the blowout again. Oh theywere just waiting for the Cap/Isles to get out of intermission. Goodthey've put a close game back on. Wait! WHATS THIS SHIT?!! THEY'RE SHOWINGTHE BLOWOUT AGAIN!AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!(Oh guess what the score is now 7-0 penguins! Switch games you $%&*#@!!!)Holy shit they're changing games! ITS ABOUT GODDAMNED TIME!! Lets see ifthey'll stay.LaterI think this proves by $#%&* point.

573,"I *loved* Dan Kelly!  He was on USA when I first got hooked on Hockey backin 1980 or so.  No, he wasn't always spot on top of the play, and hewasn't overly cute, but those pipes!  That lusty, barrel chested, voice!No pipsqueak was he (unlike some fellas we know!)I rode into hockey mania on the coattails of Gretzky and the Boys on theBus.  My first Finals saw the Islanders sweep them.  But I'll neverforget the night, a year later, when the Oilers closed it out at home inthe pandemonium, the smoke from a million sparklers, the long empty-netgoal near the end, and Dan Kelly letting the crowd's reaction tell thestory for a few long seconds, then that voice barking through the din""Dave Lumley ... sews it up for Edmonton!""  It sounds stupid, but thatearly (for me) hockey memory will always bring a thrill.  Since thenI've grown a lot more jaded about the game, but I was really saddenedby Dan Kelly's passing.  He was one of the good guys."

577,"ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY!!!  This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary, ether sucking structures, AND why we observe ""orbital"" motion!!  Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago.   I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the earth's surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!  1  I dream like this: ether based reality   The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the latticesboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. (non-spinning lattice = ""dark matter"")  The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image of a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us being stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but its ""foot print"" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])    The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is itself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the wobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The ""orbit"" of theearth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged aroundby the sun's ether feild.  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and ""distance"" apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because the ""path"" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half turn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a ""j"" hook at the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there.   With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon can be about as big as ""earth's"" shadow upon it, and at other times totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they look about the same size?   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S E       /     \                M    |      |      OR                M             \ _ _ /                                S                                    The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rateof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating ""turntable view"" of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the day. Try and draw that ""earth shadow."") Its only the moon's image which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.  ""Light-Years"" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. (defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be essentially happening now. The ""piece"" of light may have experienced many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just might carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ billion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG backwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card for Pentium!)  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound media, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which I'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. [Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I could get with my machine's receiver next to it.    If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of life's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By eating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or biblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what they did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we don't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and that is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where did the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then die)  Warning about writing to the past:I had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. There were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an Oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by ""advising"" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to provide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve souls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was finite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it seemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then some of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that he had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, existing only on the wind.   MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls whose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat others as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for playmates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back)  Accepting rides to the past:Once here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a Prince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go ahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes your work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross paths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own course of history, none the wiser.  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still make changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with every 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. But he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers.   How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, our money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: Washington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to congress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks are making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but mostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 hours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If we are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets?   In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, ""its chaos!"" They said, ""no, its order."" He defined chaos as that which is he was not able to control.  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no language. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death)(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and pointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably naive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. They can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers might have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a different frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a huge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat only fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and need a lot less sleep.  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill each other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot tall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they suck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that they aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life.   Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut from the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think that there may be some very interesting results to this, such as mother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He tells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which the people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll play a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll whine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to live on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was right, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go back and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over your destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality in which you don't want to be a part of. "

606,"NASA Headquarters distributed the following pressrelease today (4/6). I've typed it in verbatim, for youfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recentlydiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign GuidanceDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science andTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate ofthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the SpaceStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance tothe committee in their deliberations on the redesign ofthe space station.A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7billion and a high option of $9 billion will beconsidered by the committee. Each option would coverthe total expenditures for space station from fiscalyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds fordevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttleintegration, facilities, research operations support,transition cost and also must include adequate programreserves to insure program implementation within theavailable funds.Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved withinthe NASA budget for the President's new technologyinvestment. As a result, station options above $7billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions inthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a spacestation option of $9 billion would require $2 billionin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.Gibbons presented the information at an organizationalsession of the advisory committee. Generally, themembers-designate focused upon administrative topicsand used the session to get acquainted. They alsoreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientationon the process the Station Redesign Team is followingto develop options for the advisory committee toconsider.Gibbons also announced that the United States and itsinternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, andCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give""full consideration"" to use of Russian assets in thecourse of the space station redesign process.To that end, the Russians will be asked to participatein the redesign effort on an as-needed consultingbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of theirexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and thepossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities andsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope tobenefit from the expertise of the Russian participantsin assessing Russian systems and technology. Theoverall goal of the redesign effort is to developoptions for reducing station costs while preserving keyresearch and exploration capabilities. Carefulintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor inachieving that goal.Gibbons reiterated that, ""President Clinton iscommitted to the redesigned space station and to makingevery effort to preserve the science, the technologyand the jobs that the space station program represents.However, he also is committed to a space station thatis well managed and one that does not consume thenational resources which should be used to invest inthe future of this industry and this nation."""

608,"He also ignores a few other things.  While organics would becomesignificantly more expensive were all the oil to disappear (and thussome things would no longer be economically feasible), oil is hardlyan irreplaceable resource any more than most other consumables.  Assupply decreases, prices rise and alternatives become morecompetetive.  He also needs to consider that there has been anestimated 30 years of reserves pretty much as long as anyone has caredabout petroleum; whatever the current usage rate is, we always seem tohave about a 30 year reserve that we know about.[I'm not sure that last figure is still true -- we tend not to look ashard when prices are comparatively cheap -- but it was certainly trueduring hte 'oil crisis' days of the 70's.]-- ""Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world.""   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden"
609,"From the article ""What's New"" Apr-16-93 in sci.physics.research:........WHAT'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE ""SPINOFFS"" WE WERE PROMISED?In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published ""TheMan Who Sold the Moon,"" which involved a dispute over the sale ofrights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this hideous vision of the future.  Observers werestartled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at thepad with ""SCHWARZENEGGER"" painted in huge block letters on theside of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arrangedfor the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie. Now, Space Marketingis working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers ona plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earthorbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However,since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates(WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. Thismay look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO ofSpace Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of theproject is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozonemonitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs...........What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalizethe night sky?

I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wastingspace, but I thought you might want some relief from the ""So-and-so is a thief""posts.  Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would benice to hear some good news once in a while.After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller arequest for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50in his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That soundedmore than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day. Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found amessage from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailedthe money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized andassured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  Hesent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating atransfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked himto fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three timesto get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form formy signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in thedeal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world'sbest word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few goodones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatatyou may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of mysoftware from him.Bravo, Mr. Miller!"

Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to includeattitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for thingslike thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyrodata from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (youdon't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possiblecontamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also getto worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost isdone and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed forthe duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination fromthrusters and the like).The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do thereboost.

JPEG is designed for compressing eitherfull-color or gray-scale digital images of ""natural"", real-world scenes.It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or linedrawings.JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does ithandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those typesof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEGrespectively.JPEG is ""lossy"", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn'tquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves muchof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notablythe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small detailsof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that willbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, thesmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they areinvisible to the eye.A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied byadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can tradeoff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* smallfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing imagearchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if youaren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, youcan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.[2]  Why use JPEG?There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files acrossnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference indisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, thesize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have toconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Evenwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG imagethan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, usingJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order tostore or transmit an image more cheaply.It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, thetime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than theextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenetposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you haveonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantageto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete asblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailedin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images amongpeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerablymore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the firstthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color orgray-scale images of ""realistic"" scenes; that means scanned photographs andsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit displayhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixelsthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeedby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does withoutintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but theyshould be avoided in JPEG files.)JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixelsadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend tocome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, thissort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairlyoften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness isparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall betweenscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex andsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scaleimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale imagesof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether youshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, onlyapplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start froma GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEGcan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justifyconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Beprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will notconvert well.[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I havehandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first threefiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B.File	   Size in bytes		Commentsship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25			 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were			 of poorer image quality than this.ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smallerthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as theGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typicalratio for real-world scenes.[5]  What are good ""quality"" settings for JPEG?Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff byselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion aboutthe meaning of these settings.  ""Quality 95"" does NOT mean ""keep 95% of theinformation"", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;it's not a percentage of anything.The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable fromthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from oneobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  Thissetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in atypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except forexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce afile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able togo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, youmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and areprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 isabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as ""op art"".(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  OtherJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely differentquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.)[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"".(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in thesame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you canget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body.  The ""Anonymous FTPList FAQ"" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq inthe news.answers archive.NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couplemonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.[6A]  If you are looking for ""canned"" software, viewers, etc:The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on onekind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check outthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that thislist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain overInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.X Windows:John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,GIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.eduor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is theversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory onexport or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bitsinternally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bitdisplay (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV toconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first.But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to checkthe ""save at normal size"" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file willbe blurry.Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  TheImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormappeddisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or thebasic free JPEG software.Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simpleimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latestrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the currentxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The nextxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available fromexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are saidto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.MS-DOS:This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basicviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface isnot flashy, but it's functional.Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  Thecurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPUand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows andOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are nobigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fiton the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that itslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is abit tricky; read the directions carefully!A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier toinstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface isalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but alittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger thanscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and bothare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zipor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-inVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complainsthat the driver is missing.)A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking aroundthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortlyand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latestrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality ispoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see agood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of theseviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programsto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If youhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try tofind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the rightthing with hi-color displays.)The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (orjpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOScompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they willconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; inparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The majoradvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietaryJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-formatfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it isnot readable on non-PC platforms.Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulationpackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSIformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programsis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this documentrefers to directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" at Simtel20, that really means""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you shouldexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are severalInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USAmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 filesin (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"".  If you have no FTP capability, you canretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings incomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.Microsoft Windows:There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversionprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frillsviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while itdecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out thedecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEGfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other usefulfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it'san excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available fromftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment andslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirrorsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,which is roughly 25% faster.)ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promisingcontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point ithas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, thecurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, filepub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version willbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screenmode, not in a window.OS/2:The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderatoris not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4./pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.

GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.Macintosh:Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part ofthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be runningSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also installthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can getQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster andconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, isnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 fordetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing imagesthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also canconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a bigimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 andQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best colorimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView canview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it'sthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on atypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it downto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most otherviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some peoplelike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is verywell thought out.GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF andPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latestversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, butit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversioncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot ofplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter canload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet ifyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, tryconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, isavailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIFconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using thisprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, andGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixiefrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it'sreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it producesrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is anunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does notintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, calledPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trashit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a muchcleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note thatPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, butit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it onolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can'tuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of adownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If youdon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although notall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEGplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloadedJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.Amiga:(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive atamiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of thisarchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a goodchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being ageneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can readseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo versionis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images largerthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, evencapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  Thecurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirrorsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory issupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run underAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packagesthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, andImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both aredistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulationsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is anotherwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas fromamiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, fileAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, manybased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanksto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, withoutso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"",""VJPEG"", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk spaceit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.Atari ST:The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.Acorn Archimedes:!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and viewJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handleJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can befound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available byregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/writefunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other imageformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but notnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.Portable software for almost any system:If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the freeJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have adisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targaor PPM 24-bit image files.There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up everyday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you findthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whetherthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it canhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases arenot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the IndependentJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.The ""official"" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current releaseis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget toretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you mayprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available onCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearestcomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQarticle ""How to find sources"", referred to at the top of section 6.)The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG ""JFIF"" format and imagefiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in otherprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we havetested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement inproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as withanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like tocontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, thecomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representativecolors.  This process is called ""color quantization"".  (This is somethingof a misnomer, ""color selection"" would be a better term.  We're stuck withthe standard usage though.)Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for mostimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impacton the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except atthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for displayon 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, whatcomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a littledifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probablycome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets ""smeared""into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required todisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the imagesource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk aboutthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to countthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give youdifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally seeposted images described as ""256-color JPEG"".  This tells me that the poster(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), butnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in itspalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that thesender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender'squantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors thanwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorerimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantizationalgorithm, you're out of luck.For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image qualityfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's displayhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of futureimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research inthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEGimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what wassent.It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rathershoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGAdisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than youneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two colorquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it'salso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to usehigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and innormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to bedisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the averageGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit displayhardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays onworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is alreadyobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of theirdisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing imagesin a machine-independent fashion.[8]  How does JPEG work?The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosinetransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropycoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say morethan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help inusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.[9]  What about lossless JPEG?There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee diddefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees thefinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, thislossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEGalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very fewimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.Saying ""-Q 100"" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficientquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in thecolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say""-sample 1x1"" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercialJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEGalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors invarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixelvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhapshalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEGprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guaranteesbit-for-bit accuracy.If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with lessthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into theJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEGlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with aHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee wasprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the internationalstandards organizations.Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree ona common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence ofofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to""do their own thing"", and as a result their programs aren't compatible withanybody else's.The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some workthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have definedtwo JPEG-based file formats:  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a ""low-end"" format that transports    pixels and not much else.  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is    a ""high-end"" format that will let you record just about everything you    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the    mix will do anything to improve this situation.Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendorsof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercialproducts will adhere to one or both standards.I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF inpicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; theTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is stillunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is welldefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported ""lowest commondenominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTimesoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrappedinside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF andQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs areavailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editorthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIFby hand; see section 11 for details.Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF andImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIFformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed byHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not beused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (Thisapplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIFformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-formatfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likelyto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tellwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a    ""raw JPEG"" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---    it's worth a try, anyway.3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),    try stripping off everything before that.In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is	""begin"" line	M_]C_X ...whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with	""begin"" line	M:'-I ...If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble ofdownloading non-JFIF files.[12]  What about arithmetic coding?The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules for the final outputof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usuallyproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic codingproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All thefile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by theJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licensesfrom these companies.  (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people to implementand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubiousat best.)At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry aboutarithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify thepotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in thefuture.  Stay tuned for further details.[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you coulddecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress itwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an alteredimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost thefirst time around.The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompressit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get anidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the currentfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundofferror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventuallydegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generationoutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error canbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be thatcompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the originalquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changesas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, butthat's a mighty limited capability!)The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage andtransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediateformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you areready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lotof compression/decompression time this way :-).[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if youconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the originalfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG fromthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimumloss of quality.The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, tomake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher qualitysetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained insection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colorsdon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable qualitywill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the bestcandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offerthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don'texpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those createddirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may haveto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-throughJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-colorborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms ofstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharpborder boundary can create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges).  Do yourselfa favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windowssystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painlessway to do this.)cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, butfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoidimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higherQ setting may not be necessary.)Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually ""dithered"" to foolyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often ofsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixelstogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  Thetrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequencycolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEGfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would havegotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).To get around this, you want to ""smooth"" the GIF image before compression.Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color thatyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapidcolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing willoften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size ofthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output imagethan you'd get without smoothing.With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothingcapability is built in.  Try ""-smooth 10"" or so when converting GIFs.Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handeddithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regularfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strongsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blurthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processingwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such aspnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother isa LOT faster than pnmconvol...The upshot of all this is that ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" is probably agood starting point for converting GIFs.

646,"First, thanks to all who replied to my original question."
650,"I have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outliningone of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered inCrystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and canbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail atmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.Mark proposed this design, which he calls ""Geode"" (""rough on theoutside, but a gem on the inside"") or the ""ET Strongback withintegrated hab modules and centrifuge.""  As you can see from filegeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of muchof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  Thewhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station RemonteManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrustingcan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the massproperties of the Station change during assembly.The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily becauseit can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strongpart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces arelimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of thedocking system.The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additionallaunch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've neverhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventualde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent theresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit fromimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy aKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminatingthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providingfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as thenucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control MomentGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be usedfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit systemwhich can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform acontrolled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like wedid with Skylab).The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could beused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravityon humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage devicefor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted onone of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF workdone to date.Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City,and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumorsI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiterseems more likely.Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design;you should see his notes in the GIF files.  Instead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these foranon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.  I'lllet you all know when I get that done.-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368"

670,"The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter. You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized. It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally, the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi. That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions(when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching. The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaurdoes. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be done there........The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don't know what the proton uses for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems could be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with providing centaur GSE to Russia. That issue alone might be enough to kill this idea. "

They should know a lot about the possibilities, I haven't heard thempropose US launches, so I assume they looked into it and found it unprofitable. Yes...Comparable to the Zenit I suppose, but since it looks likenothing will be built there, you might just as well pick anyspot.The message is: to launch now while its cheap and while Russia andKazakstan are still cooperating.

Any three of them must benon-collinear (otherwise all three could not lie on the surfaceof a sphere) and all four must not be coplaner (otherwise eitherthey cannot all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them).A, B and C define a circle. The perpendicular bisectors of AB, BCand CA  meet in a point (P, say) which is the centre of this circle.This circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere.Consider the normal to the plane ABC passing through P. All pointson this normal are equidistant from A, B and C and its circle (infact it is a diameter of the desired sphere).

732,"SSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right thistime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:[1] microgravity/vacuum process research[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)[3] spacecraft maintenence The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was tocentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meettheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganizationand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on thesetwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvementin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the constellation.  Firstly, different functions are broken down into different constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the taskis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environmentsand are also prime candidates for constellization.[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab forshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area isinexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelabto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.We might also expand the research program to take advantage of interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system canbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiationenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelterof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, sinceastronauts will have little practical use in the space programuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, usingastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellationtether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravityin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of theradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life supportmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VRinterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billionsare spent on astronauts.[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperatedrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers canpractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stucksolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can bespun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsatcompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.By applying the successful constellation strategy, and gettingrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, wehave radically improved the capability of the program whilegreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can studylife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuumresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purposeorbits.N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space explorationas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be usedto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting andsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology canbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecologygreenhouses on Mars at low cost."

April 23, 1993(Phone:  202/358-1780)Kyle HerringJohnson Space Center, Houston(Phone:  713/483-5111)RELEASE:  93-76HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS	The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 toservice the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 daymission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capabilityfor an additional two, if needed.	The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, wasreached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver timesrequired using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actualEVA tasks on previous missions.	""Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three isto repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to thedynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,"" Mission Director Randy Brinkley said.""It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing addedflexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.""	In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of thespacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arraysand the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the CorrectiveOptics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectivesduring the mission.	""When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest throughlowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for eachspacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate,"" said Milt Heflin, Lead FlightDirector for the mission.	While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of twoalternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew thanprevious missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.	""We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previousspacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,""Heflin said.  ""In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary toformulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possibleto accomplish the mission objectives.""	Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessionsthat include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integratedsimulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand aloneunderwater training ""runs"" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.	Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will bemade based on actual training experience during the months prior to themission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flightwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.	Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will includespacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between theactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks atthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,Huntsville, Ala.	Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gainingfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand theexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers andtrainers.	Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built withgrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.	The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At thattime the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may havebecome necessary."

747,"No.  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost, and Ron Hextall is thereason Quebec won.  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, thatgoaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you'reMontreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it;he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just anexcuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worstgoals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides,Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to cleartraffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don'tthink this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should letthe damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe thisarticle, if possible.I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn'tthink Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who)in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone inregardless.Yep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second,IMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen ateam so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of theirzone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red Army.  But I still hate the team.On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on apowerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit. Same goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely iswaving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  NewJersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario isunbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.  But I hate that team anyway."

Very few fans real-istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet theystill go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling thegame by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, theNBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they aretrying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, beingbenificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totalsthat would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants toattract, that these players are indeed superstars.It ain't nearly so simple as this.  The casual fan doesn't think about much at all.  Can you actually find an adult with a 3 digit IQ who believes thatMcDonalds makes good hamburgers?

I also realize that $45 isalot of money, especially if you don't normally collect cards. So if enoughpeople are interested, I'll break up the set into team sets. I'm not surehow much for each. It would be nice to just sell them for $3 each, but thenthe people who get the Whalers and Devils (Note, I'm not bagging on these teamsits just that they don't have alot of good rookie cards in this set) wouldbe subsidizing the people who want Chicago or Pittsburgh. So I'll have to makeit varialble pricing. But most of them should be about $2 or $3 dollars.Ok someone asked for this one, but he's from Canada, if he can get me thebe the alternate.Also I would like to sell 2 Upperdeck Pavel Bure rookie cards (note theseare not in the UD low #'s set mentioned above). $16 each.

805,"I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place anobject at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbitalvelocity.  For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth,you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specificimpulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dryweight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer.A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand orbirdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would bethe payload.  I am sure the whole project is well withinthe capability of the amateur rocketry community.It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reductionof Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'.Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussedhere: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 yearon the moon, $1 million for the first erradication ofan orbital eyesore/CCD burner.

815,"The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside ofthe orbit of Mercury.The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observedperihelion precession and the value it should have had according toNewtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observationsand calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe laterimproved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's systemof equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptuneand since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbitof Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing wasafoot with Mercury.But alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rateit does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantlycurved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamicsof moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one ofit's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precessionof Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb'snumbers rather than Leverrier's.)Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequentefforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radarhave been fruitless.-Bill Gawne ""Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe  are the laws of the universe.""                       - G.

817,"Wishful thinking mostly. It's more likely that the Moon will neverbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has nomaterials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroidsand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in lowgrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat sink capacity could offer some military utility for ""high ground"" militaryweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor activity in the global scope of things.Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to preventcalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it'stoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factoriesthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Lunahas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbitalsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offersa source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light andheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravitywells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtuallyignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have todeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much moreexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use theeasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a fewcenturies, if not much longer.Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radioastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the siteof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system fordefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first isunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are goodenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe forconventional warfare again.

821,Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special casewith no solution that worried me.Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere that they are on the surface of.Similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on thesurface of.These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically designmeet these problems neatly.When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinearthe algorithm should afil or return infinite R.When intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilitiesthey are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle)they are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius.This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th pointby taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be producedit can also be achieved byIf all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle. It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar.The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar.(4 points being colinear => coplanar)Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 pointshas been found is trivial.

871,"re: majority of users not readding from floppy.Well, how about those of us who have 1400-picture CD-ROMS and would like to useCVIEW because it is fast and it works well, but can't because the moron lackedthe foresight to create the temp file in the program's path, not the currentdidrectory?"
874,"A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView.Since he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to postit for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the mostannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has todo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no controlover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its""current directory"".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CViewdoesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colourinformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the ""dithering"", again writinganother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing thissecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it doesthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file toyour screen again.  (It does this last ""recopy"" operation for its""fit to screen"" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.) The result of this process is the following:       1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the        dithering and writes to the screen card.        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which        there was room on the disk.This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the generalidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in detailsabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficientdisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can bevery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excessof 6 Meg free disk space.CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file froma floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on thefloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FATtable? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly insertedfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possiblyunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for aprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Filesmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves thehi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at oncewhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take tosort a directory listing?"

878,"In the April edition of ""One Small Step for a Space Activist"",Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:  ""Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes   the 'center tax'). When work for a large program like   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10   billion won't be spent on anything having anything   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the   term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are   getting and the price they are paying and note that   it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware   that a third of the money is going for something else.""My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A coupleof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, Italked with one of the cost experts here in Space Stationat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post aresponse immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposedto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHzdata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty lowon the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekendin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSFto 15,000 science teachers.]First off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' doesexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4center 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is04/2.2 = 1.8%Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but Iwill concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocketchange.I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 couldbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on fundsthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at somestates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eatthe food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get ittake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the fundswe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*subject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers infront of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 fundsgo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a taxrate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at thecenter, and not to the prime contracts.This leads to the obvious question ""What is the governmentdoing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors?(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. Abig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happensto the balance of the funds, which aren't eatenup by the center tax?)""At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supportingdevelopment funds (as they are supporting the developmentwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds tosetup our own testbed, to checkout the electricalpower system architecture. Our testbed has a real lifesolar array field (left over from solar cell researchresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DCswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulatedloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recentchange evaluation involving concerns about the stabilityof the power system.We have also used the supporting development money topurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on lifetesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility inIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells ontest recently hit the four year life test milestone.38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (theon-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).As a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis usedthe supporting development funds to purchase personalcomputers and work stations, for performing systemanalyses (like modeling of the performance of theelectrical power system, availability calculationsusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a database with information on weight of the powersystem elements).Finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not allgo into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the directordoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal tothe director to get money from this fund to lookat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'services at the Center, like the library, the central computer services division, the Contractor who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is ratherdifficult to determine what percentage of theSSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To getan accurate figure, you would have to takethe annual expenditure for the library (for example),and then divide by the amount of the library fundsused to support SSF (which would be hard tocompute by itself - how would you figure outwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it onthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-weekversus the rest of the center personnel). You wouldthen have to compare this estimate of the SSFportion of the library expense with the portion ofthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, butwe underpay for snow removal? Talk abouta burecratic nightmare!"
880,"I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no meansinfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is granted to copy this without restriction.Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at aninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament andInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because thecompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped thathis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tongato visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thoughtthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronoussatellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot ofslots.The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and CarlHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinionssupporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from 70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in theworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and the Pacific Rim. RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a taxhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, tofill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would havecost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money.Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time.Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the waythat people operate.  For example ""everybody can sell you everything.""  Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are theonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a costof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternbergsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos wasout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  Heagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessionsbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has builtabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented thatsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honestpeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At thispoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion onboth siberians and midwesterners :-)Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite thatwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellitesthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  Thiscompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can giveyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they aregetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into placenow.Tidbits:*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not bigbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, exceptthat ""we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.""*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launchwithin 9 months.*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirementfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says issort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worriedpartly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvaryingmonolith.  Italy gets a new government ""every two weeks"" but we don't worry because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing whatreally goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transferingmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the ""equivalent"" value in rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrianbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so thatthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same typeof satellites, which was rather reassuring.*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitivetechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites havea lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites comparewell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newertechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of datehardware."

903,"By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch StaffAt 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute tothe playoff-bound Blues.The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3.With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and thefinal playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quitplaying.They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appearedwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleepand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiatingsupervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that theshot had gone into the net after time had expired.``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,"" Blues coach Bob Berry said.If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues'disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and makingthe playoffs tempered Berry's anger.``It wasn't pretty at the end,"" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, asgood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, butit did.""Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end.Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil thisseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawksin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday atChicago Stadium.The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three pointsbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended itsfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyousBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.``It's a shame we let down,"" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to scoretwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would haveended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.""Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.``We won, and that's all that matters,"" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.""Some players didn't have a problem.``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,"" said RichSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. Youcan't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.``It was disappointing to see what was going on.""Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow,he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.``I didn't know it was final,"" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on thebench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs,and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at theend.""The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboardoperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The scoreshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the thirdperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,""Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.""If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win mightbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowdgoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, dekeddefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with therebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonskiafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game ofthe season and reminded him of a special friend.Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare formof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,"" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, andI know he was watching. I know he's happy.""Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zomboat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 secondslater, making it 5-1.Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Berglandscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a passfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the thirdperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goalsto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the thirdperiod.The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as thewinner. ``We were in there,"" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in."""

931,"How could this possibly be ""environmental vandalism"" when there is no""environment"" to vandalize up there?Since the advertising ""is just to help defray costs"", it's certainly nosurprise that ""the taxpayers would bear most of the expense"".  Soundslike a good idea to me, since the taxpayers would bear _all_ of theexpense if they didn't do the advertising.Great idea, they should have done it long ago.I can't believe that a mile-long billboard would have any significanteffect on the overall sky brightness.  Venus is visible during the day,but nobody complains about that.  Besides, it's in LEO, so it would onlybe visible during twilight when the sky is already bright, and even ifit would have some miniscule impact, it would be only for a short timeas it goes zipping across the sky.No doubt.  People are always looking for something to protest about, soit would be no surprise.Well, look on the, er, bright side.

936,"<In response to a debate about who has has a better season- Jagr of Francis>I think Jagr did he probably had a better point per minute ice time- statsdon't exist to properly analyze this and he had a substancially better +/-.+/- is a useful statistic.  If a player is on the ice when his team scores alot of goals and only allows a few goals, he must be doing something right.It is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for thesame team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equallygood players.  It can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to comparebetween players on different teams.I agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics- but how usefulare the ones that you suggest??  Total ice time would be very useful- it isa missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before.  Somehow measuringthe quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.  It would be abetter stat for evaluating coaching- ie are the players given quality icetime actually their talented ones?  A very good player could be given lowamounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach whodoesn't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots ofquality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach thatthinks he is an effective player.  This stat would be much more flawed than+/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent.+/- is a useful stat.  It is quite useful in evaluating player talent.You are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to seethat being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowedis a very positive thing- and should be evaluated as such."

953,"How long can the Leafs play short-handed and still be expected toscore?  They did some fine penely-killing in the first (2 men downfor a couple of minutes at one point) but they just couldn't keep it up.  They spent virtually the entire game either short-handed orjust coming off a penelty -- as soon as they'd get re-grouped, they'repenalized again! Sheesh -- like Gilmour said after the 1st -- you can't go calling every little push an shove in a game like that.  And if you're goingto, you have to do it for both teams. Pearson (one of my four favorite Leafs) played like a bonehead -- Isaw him personally screw up at least 2 good scoring opportunities, andthen he got that *bonehead* 5-minute major high-sticking penalty. Cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand-full ofgames ago and he played a good game.  If the other players on his linecan smarten up, that line should do okay.  Clark's got to get tough --he's got to intimidate and go for the net.  Send Clark up the left wing over the blue line a couple times... his patented wrist shot willput some numbers on the board... and Pearson... heck, maybe he shouldbe benched. I hate to repeat Grapes, but where the heck was Foligno?  Zezel can'tdo all the checking himself -- and get MacLlwain on the move... we need some speed out there!  Keep Potvin in net, he did okay considering... although (like I said a couple weeks ago) Potvin messed up in a couple games in the AHL playoffs last year -- he can easily do it again. My prediction last week was Toronto in 7 -- that the games DET wins will be blow-outs and the game TOR wins will be close -- I still standby that. Don't fret, Leafs fans, in order to win in 7, the other team has towin 3! :-) Burns is going to make some magic -- he'll mix up some lines.  Matchthe Wings line-per-line.  He'll have his team checking hard, and he'llnever let them get out-numbered in their own end.  The Leafs will winWednesday night... and will take 1 or their home games (probably thefirst one)."

958,"   Nick Haines sez;   >(given that I've heard the Shuttle software rated as Level 5 in   >maturity, I strongly doubt that this [having lots of bugs] is the case).   Level 5?  Out of how many?  What are the different levels?  I've never   heard of this rating system.  Anyone care to clue me in?This is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations tomeasure the maturity of a `software process' i.e. the entire processby which software gets designed, written, tested, delivered, supportedetc.See `Managing the Software Process', by Watts S. Humphrey, AddisonWesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels ofsoftware process maturity are:1. Initial2. Repeatable3. Defined4. Managed5. OptimizingThe levels are approximately characterized as follows:1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical   basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will   take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will   be.  Most software production is at this level.2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project   management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects   are planned in detail, and there is software configuration   management and quality assurance.3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is   consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a   rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,   and typically a `software engineering process group' within the   project.4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered   and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this   information. Software quality is measured and has goals.5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts   are effective and certified."

960,"There has been something bothering me while watchingNASA Select for a while.  Well, I should'nt saybothering, maybe wondering would be better.

961,"No.  The idea was suggested around here during discussions of possiblenear-term commercial space activities.  One of the folks involved in thosediscussions, aspacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to some entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead withit.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on the sensors that might be carried.Actually, that sounds unlikely.  I don't know what the launch vehiclewould be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher --certainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASAfor, e.g.,  launch support would probably cover NASA's incremental costs pretty well.No, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per Clementine and related programs.  I'm sure folks around here would like to see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all, the U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structurewould not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was(or a parade balloon, for that matter).While I happen to personally dislike the idea, mostly because I've gota background in astronomy, it's hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-livedintrusion on the night sky, doing no permanent damage and actually hurtingonly a small subset of astronomers.  On the other hand, it would certainlydraw attention to space.   Which, unfortunately, this is not likely to contribute much to.As far as I know, it's a purely commercial venture.I gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers.Commercial projects, however, generally don't get ""funding"" -- theyget ""customers"" -- whether it will have customers remains to be seen.Nahh.

They are too small.  The key to any Leafs successwill have to be Clark.  He is the only centre who can haveany presence within 3-stick lengths of the slot.  Where thehell is Anderson?  Anderson can (in days past) get under peoplesskin.  Put a little more bluntly, Anderson has to be an asshole.He used to be good at it.  We need him now.  Perhaps, perhaps the Leafs can shut down Detroit's second line.I was dissappointed to see Shepard and Yserbeart flying last night.These guys are the ""swing"" players for the Wings.  Last year theydid a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quickexit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmourshould be able to out hustle this line.  Anderson should do anasty on Yserbeart.  Clark should bang the hell out of Sheppard.  Score Gilmour score!Suggestions:  Clarke-Anderson-Gilmour vs. Sheppard-Yserbeart-??

However,		if the Detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their		checking line against these ""finesse"" players - well then		let them play.** Potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals - keep him in.** Van Hellamond can not be faulted for the Leafs demise either.** The Wings defense shut down the Leafs (especially in the slot).I hope Pat Burns realizes that his team was out-hit, out-skated, andout-coached on Monday night.

990,"Let's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing; in this case aboat, but it could be anything.  On the drawing you have a set ofreference points whose true x,y positions are known.  Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using YaronDanon's excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program whichconverts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you clickthe mouse.Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that comeout of the digitizing process differ in small but significant waysfrom the known true values.  This is understandable because thescanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there aresuccessive sources of distortion such as differential expansion andcontraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,scanner errors and what have you.The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so ""global""adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, orrotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm forremoving such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets ofpoints Reference(x,y) (the known true values)DistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)DistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply toDistortedData to remove the errors.I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distortedreference points as resulting from the projection of a ""bumpy"" 3dsurface, solving for the surface and then ""flattening"" it to removethe errors in the other data points.Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet,pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?Thanks,"

Modern analogies, such as the prize for ahuman powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economicbenefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developedand the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the equivalent amount of direct investment would.

Its easy enough to convert,but if I don't know which way they are stored, I dont know which direction the polygon should be visible from.If DXF doesn't handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround?The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each onein the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.

1035,"Rather than decide which book you want to buy, you need to decide whichprogramming interface you want to use, then buy the appropriate book.I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differencesbetween PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be outpretty soon).  But here's a brief summary...PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to manydevices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and takeadvantage of a 3D extension to X called ""PEX"".  PEXlib is a slightly""lower"" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEXextension to X.Some advantages of using PEXlib...- Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS- Provides immediate mode capabilities- Is free of ""policy""- PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support  features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).  PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.Some advantages of using PHIGS...- Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones- Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output- PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier- PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you- PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.If you're working strictly in X and don't care about things likearchiving, I would go with PEXlib.

1048,"Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.  The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for theLaser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas gunshave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physicallylocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that theoffice he works for is an administrative convenience.I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamberabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at severalhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the pistonis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tensof atmospheres.The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it untila stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inchbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. theyintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrelcould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having tomove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being usedin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameterand about 50 cm long.All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogengas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves thebarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with asheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  Theplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trappedin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plasticwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plasticprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,the projectile vaporizes.The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range isabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 kmif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gunto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they canfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFBto follow the projectiles.The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last testthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think ithad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, butI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).There are people waiting to test scramjet components in thisgun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basicallya proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kguseful payload to orbit.Dani Eder"

1073,"Well, the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night. The Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Islesbeat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.	However, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey ingeneral that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders back-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that the Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveablehow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty wide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played a golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL debut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a Mahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot correctly.  Has anyone else noticed this?	Also, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like MickVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockeytalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets thepuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. Richard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he's adefenseman.  He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. This guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such ""enforcers""?  Notonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who arereally trying to play the game.  I'll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a good fight once in a while, but only when it's ""called for"".  You know, when aguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of ""hockey ethics""might cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you arelosing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that refereesneed to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. I'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase thereferee doesn't call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,not physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost.

I was wondering if anyone can shed light on this, or pointme in the right place to look...We have an X-ray imaging camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical holepassing through it at a right angle to the tube's axis:                                                          |                                     ||                   [ image                                                          |  X-ray source ]                     ||                   | screen                            metallic || tube              |                                     ||                   |                                                          |We know source--screen centre distance, radius of the tube, radius of the hole.We do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen.  However,the calculations are mathematically highly complex, and must assume that theobject's hole projects an image (resembling an ellipse if the tube is notparallel to the screen) in the centre of the screen.  However, it is unlikelythat the object is placed so conveniently.  Firstly, we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse.  I cannotknow what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume thatthey are parallel to do the transformation?  How do I do this transformation?Secondly, there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar(the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of thescreen).  How can I compensate the ellipse's axis for this image distortion?So, please can anyone give us a few pointers here?  How do we transform theimage so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen, and howdo I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen?We'd appreciate any help, either posted or emailed.Thanks in advance, Simon."

1082,"The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit 'fuzzy regions'.  Theseare described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in athree body system.  The probe was launched into this region for theearth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as toallow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slowdown. The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured withoutexpending fuel, we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible"". Theoriginator of the technique said that NASA wasn't interested, but that Japanwas because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel fordeceleration.

1093,"From this account, it doesn't sound like you even saw the goal, Mike. Smithcame out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in theback of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw whathappened. The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net. Fuhr neverhad a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender, in fact Perry Berezanof Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it. It was unfortunate that it happened; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookieat the time, and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Startingin pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of their own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the goaltender, or whatever.And to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series, I can onlysay that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games.There was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied latein the third period of the 7th game of the second round.

1100,"Let's see. These aren't, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. That termdenotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. Therockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, todistinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-madeammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engineswith graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A ""D""engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse.An ""F"" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to adoubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size ""O"" areavailable pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above areshipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines ofsize F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not ascontrolled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocketengines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)There is an HPR Society, The Tripoli Rocket Society, I believe, whichholds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities(FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association ofRocketry is more concerned with engines below H, though it is involvedin HPR as well. These societies certify users of HPR rockets, andcompanies will not sell to uncertified individuals.Bottom Line: It's legit. I suggest you send for a catalog - but forgetthe dynamite, will ya?"

1115,"In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solidrockets as payloads.  Thiokol provided me with samples and data ona reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solidmotor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percentAluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure.The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspectsome bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you madea bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is whatyou get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires inall directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated intothe voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  Thefoamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant,so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The majorimprovement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is theprincipal failure mode for solid propellant.Dani Eder"

1134,"    Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the factthat far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For muchof the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down theindustry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retiredand Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the pointwhere long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note thatthe Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh,Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.  ""When it's time to railroad,you railroad.""  Not off the top of my head; I'll have to dig out my reference books again.However, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry theNavigator's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money andmerchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then beshared.  The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire aMoon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporationscan even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft),Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required werewithin the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were wellwithin the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that onlya gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.

1141,"That would not explain why widely separated detectors, such as on Ulyssesand PVO and Ginga et al., would see a burst at the same time(*).  In fact, be-fore BATSE, having this widely separated ""Interplanetary Network"" was theonly sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannotlocate a burst (except to say ""It's somewhere in the field of view."").  Withtwo detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detectorto narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors,one gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  If one of theselocations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the sky), voila, you have an error box.BATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination,but only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, liketo comment on the current state of location determination?).  Having inde-pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.You did touch on something that you didn't mean to, though.  Some believe(in a reference that I have somewhere) that absorption-like features seenin a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector.

1153,"Yeah, and it's also true most long complicated sequences of events,calculations, or big computer programs in general.  I don't arguethat you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, Ijust question whether you >should<.The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that wecan't model should be replaced with a random number generator.  Thathas been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to humanperception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don'tthink it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would ratherthat the model be improved in a more explicable manner.I guess I just haven't seen all these earth-shaking fractal modelsthat explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  Ireally hope I do, but I'm not holding my self-similar breath.Uh huh.  I'll believe it when I see it.  I've been chasing fractalcompression for a few years, and I still don't believe in it.  If it's sogreat, how come we don't see it competing with JPEG?  'Cause it can't,I'll wager.Actually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compressionwork- and I was trying- because I don't think it's a reasonablealternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)I'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That's why Idon't think fractal compression as it is widely explained ispractical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up theirsleeves that make their demos work, but I don't see anyone using it in areal product.  It's been six years since Iterated Systems was formed,right?

So wind has to bend away from thewing edges.   AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.If they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and forcecompression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).If you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bendinto,  then drag is reduced.   Essentially,  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulfremain constant for all areas of the fuselage.

Percentages, as used inthe other major sports are clearly more informative.  When I look at theNHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation toaccount for games in hand (which is almost always the case).  Some willobject to percentages, claiming perhaps, that it is an ""Americanization""of the sport but I feel that using percentages is more informative andwhether it is ""American"" or not is irrelevant. Even if Orr couldn't have contributed without the likes of Norris, you wouldhave to agree that Norris couldn't have contributed without the likes of Orr.And taking a poll of most fans would quickly tell you who the fans feel madethe more meaningful contribution.It doesn't look as if the division names are going to hold up either does it?-- "

(These measurements are statistical, and you canalways hide a sufficiently small number of a differenttype of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assumingthat there is only one population of GRBs).The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the centerof the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact centerof are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of cometsway beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placingGRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies tobe released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud modelstend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy)you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane ofthe Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center(for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if theyare Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years inradius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the AndromedaGalaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, theEarth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don'tsee many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature.Right now, the theorists have a sort of unofficial moratoriumon new models until new observational evidence comes in."

1195,"There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today'sLA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I'd post it tostir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it bysaying that I largely agree that the ""Space Age"" in the romantic senseof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space stationmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, ""What's New"" -the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that theromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation ofmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (withits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing thingspeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, Ithink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter ofnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our ""mindchildren"" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); butI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting aboutwhat we can do *now*.   Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEWMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)At 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of amidlife crisis.The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies nolonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economicrewards.  Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's scienceand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not ameaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, ourtechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversionpolicy.  To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologiesfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probeswould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver ofscientific and industrial innovation is now dead......Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish towrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressivelysupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billionto build space station Freedom alone.Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspokenpublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that muchof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescopeto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressivelyimplemented did not seem to matter much.Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherentvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollarspace budgets.Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apolloera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space explorationwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  ......While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded DanielGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not beingpositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America'stechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - beenslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration championsits competitiveness agenda......."

1236,"I recently backed out of purchasing an almost-unused Sony TCD-D3 DATWalkman, having found someone else who has a unit I personally prefer (and ampaying more for).  However, it's still a heck of a machine for the price -- itis quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It's probably themost popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)        Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), andhere's what he told me:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here is what is included:        - TCD-D3 DATman.        - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8"" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for          analog output.        - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).        - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The          unit is still under factory warrantee.        - AC adaptor/battery charger.        - Rechargable battery.I paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don't mind if I keep the 60 minutetape it came with (I have some samples on it!).[By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he's including an extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5 years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------        I'm not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice.Send him mail and ask him what he wants.        Again, I've used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainlyunderstand why it is as popular as it is.  I've been using one for a littlewhile, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also pointout that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years andhad truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machinethat was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz ButcherConspiracy for their recent live album.)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------I know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labelsin S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reportedproblem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------        'nuff said.        The reason I'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me aunit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don't have anyoptical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also hassome other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn't.  (I am also paying morefor the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters areavailable if you absolutely must have one.        Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.

(Healso noted that the software people were starting to feel managementpressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get thingsright for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failureduring those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure.As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be countedon one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software.Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by theexperimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care.(None of the experimenters could afford it.)"

Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the   tanks big enough.Our sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and atelescope cluster, weighs around 1100 pounds.  It uses freon jets forsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ieduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty muchcontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets alsoneed to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, andflip the payload around to look at the Sun.We have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I'm speakingonly from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose howmuch freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.

1314,"OpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portableinterface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. Itis not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary stronglyfrom machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to highperformance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGLmeans that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is noguarantee that your performance would be comparable.If your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have avalid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGIsales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...weunderstand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it ashot.As one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock ratessped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5years. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI('88-'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the PowerSeries parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at aparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphicsarchitectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every18 months to 2 years.These are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they becomealmost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a newplatform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,faster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If wedon't, we become uncompetitive.From the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets yourcurrent needs and makes economic sense today.  You can't wait to buy, butif you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Repfor one in writing. If it's feasible, they should be able to do that. Someof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such asthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Seriesmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtaina guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or ChallengeR4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.If that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings ormis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy ourcustomer base.Most SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give agreat deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system becauseagain, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the scheduleslipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they werecounting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) andwould also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financialanalysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting ourcommitments.Five years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processortechnologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer atleast 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive natureof the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing isreally 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viabilityof whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.There are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to livewith, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don't give up,we know it.Josh   |:-)-- "

1318,"[Excellent discussion of DC-X landing techniques by Henry deleted]The DC-X will not take of horizontally.  It takes of vertically. For several reasons.  Vertical landings don't require miles of runway and limitnoise pollution.  They don't require wheels or wings.  Just turn on the enginesand touch down.  Of course, as Henry pointed out, vetical landings aren't quitethat simple.Well, to be blunt, yes.  But at least you're learning.The Soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rocketsjust before they hit the ground.  Parachutes are, however, not especiallypractical if you want to reuse something without much effort.  The landingsare also not very comfortable.

1323,"Sorry, Nelson, but you forgot to ask me. If you check the THN stats forKansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, havingplayed in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.Well, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn't quiteaccurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,which was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it becausehe knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at whichpoint he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks andhe disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for notreporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him asinjured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shippedhim down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearlynot with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just ano-no).Very nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he washurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probablyanother expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest ofhis career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other playersmotivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with abad judgement call.Always gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), buthustle isn't always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to meone night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried tohold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto'sneck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turnedaround and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carterwasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.The Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbieMcDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me""you have to make room for the kids"". Carter, in fact, refused to report toK.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defactoretirement, but I haven't heard anything official. His only hope in hockeynow is the Gulls.Because, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and lookedfairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn't think hewas quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.Agreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how youwish they'd performed than how they actually performed. I wonder whether youcan really judge talent from radio and television, Nelson? I know I havetrouble, since you don't see the off-puck action. your views from home andmy views from the ice differ in numerous ways)Coffee. Coffey is with the Red Wings.You? Nah... He was seriously unimpressive, even as a tough guy (his rep). However, asfew games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless, I hateto judge the talent too quickly.

1324,"Hi to all.Since all of you could also be a seller as well as a buyer, I'd like to bringthis issue for discussion - what would be the best solution in case a deal became a lemon?As I understand most people selling things over the net do not grant a warranty,I am in such a situation that the seller did not state whether a warranty would be granted or not and the item I received is out of order. The seller insistedthat it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that I paid if I send the item back to him and after he is sured itis bad. Is this reasonable?Basically I would like to believe the seller tells the truth. Also, I am positively to say that I've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of the thing.

Given the lack of respect he commands, though, I doubt he will win it.  The other reason concerns the Pens' team defense.  They are hovering around 3rd or 4th in thefewest goals allowed.  That is a big improvement for them, and it indicatesthat they are playing better team defense.We'll see.  It'll be fun."

NASA is directlydescended from the NACA, with space added in.You'll notice that I didn't mention sweep wings even though theX-5, tested at what's now Dryden, had them.  We did steal that onedirctly from the Germans.  The difference is that swept wings don'tchange their angle of sweep, sweep wings do.  Perhaps the similarityof names has caused some confusion?  747s have swept wings, F-111shave sweep wings.Phil> A lot of this was also done by the military...After NASA aerodynamicists proposed them and NASA test teamsdemonstrated them.

It's true that weused military aircraft as the testbeds (KC-135 and YF-102) butthat had more to do with availability and need than with militaryinvolvement.

1336,"                          ^^      Funny you should mention it...this is exactly the case I was going to make.I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks. But this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase will last, unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kickingone.  Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to supportthem.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgeryfor some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.  Ok.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book. You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is thatit wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.a winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. Andbefore anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go backand read from where this thread started...It might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenlyfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it ""gee, Mario Lemieux isamazing, I'll go watch him play"", or was it ""gee, now we've got a *kick**ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play"".  I think it was the latter.I don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go tothe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticketholders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kingsinitial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)and corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop inattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  Whether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that sinceGretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claimthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oilerdynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't likeMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, andthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandisingsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there littletailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at theForum even if the tickets were sold.For the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the teamwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because theymake people around them better.Well, at least we are in full agreement here!So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>Yes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type ofreasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra peopleshowing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you thinkthat if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after theywill maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in thatcase the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or withoutSelanne."

1355,"From another space forum    When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56 solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB.  The tool survived the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.    NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,    ""It's been a long time since something like this happened.  We've lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this.""    The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the report and Discovery was launched with its ""extra payload"".  NASA officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th launch date.    The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster, its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.    A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that the Shuttle processor will take ""appropriate action"".  Thiokol is a subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch._________________________________________________________Karl Anderson	DEV/2000: Configuration Management/Version ControlDept 53K/006-2		Rochester, Minnesota 55901253-8044		Tie 8-453-8044INTERNET: karl@vnet.ibm.comPRODIGY: CMMG96A"

1372,"   Sean, the 68070 exists! :-)   Sean, I don't want to get into a 'mini-war' by what I am going to say,but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you areclaiming on the Centris, you'll see why (please, no-flames, I reservethose for c.s.m.a :-) )   I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show, and Apple had abooth there.  I walked by, and they were showing real-time video captureusing a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spotquicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one(1.5).   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quitenicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that itwasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then heincreased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps.    Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't knowwhat model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktimecould play back at the same speed even on an LCII.   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was havinga little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This wasfrom memory!   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or somehardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the animation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I canclaim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in my computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.

1375,"I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 orTrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan convertedby a 3D scanline renderer. I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years buthave never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have theopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to havesome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules toturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handlecomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simplepolygons). For example, in the letter ""O"" there are two outlines:	1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)	2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where thetwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a ""polygon withholes"". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interiorpolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.I do not want to use this simplistic system since:	1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple		matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for		some fancy fonts).	2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoiddecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (asis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidalpolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.My question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines intopolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solutionsince it creates excess number of polygons.Another question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to createbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on thesesubjects but I can't tell which method is the best to implement.Thanks for any pointers.--> Rob Lansdale"

1380,"I agree with you about the upgrade path; but I think I was fair.The original posting complained (1) about SGI coming out with newer (andbetter) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones,and (2) that DEC did.On statement (1), I merely attempted to point out that all computercompanies are constantly attempting to improve their product (& marketposition/share).  In so doing, they eventually come to a point where theyhave a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace thesystem.  And the particular system he was complaining about was (incomputer lifetimes) relatively old.On statement (2), I felt DEC's history of providing upgrades was not farsuperior than the industry ""average"", and that, in my opinion, SGI'shistory is better than DEC's.(And what is DEC doing with it's MIPS based DECstation line?  Are theygoing to ""abandon"" it for their Alpha based line, or provide an upgradepath to R4400's and TFP's and R5's?)"

1401,"Suppose the Soviets had managed to get their moon rocket workingand had made it first.  They could have beaten us if either:* Their rocket hadn't blown up on the pad thus setting them back,and/or* A Saturn V went boom.If they had beaten us, I speculate that the US would have gonehead and done some landings, but we also would have been moredetermined to set up a base (both in Earth Orbit and on theMoon).  Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would dependupon whether the Soviets tried to go.  Setting up a lunar basewould have stretched the budgets of both nations and I thinkthat the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the valueof going to Mars (at least in the short run).  Thus we wouldhave concentrated on the moon."

1406,"For the purpose of a contest, I'd bet some things could be cut.  Like fuelfor re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if thecontest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't beworth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapestheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If Idon't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.But back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about alow cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A GeneralDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upperstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering twounmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. Total cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9billion for the US share.I didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet thatits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metrictonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crewhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes forthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* beable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,that's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoorseats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (orcollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's roundthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 tonpayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, twoLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for ayear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way ofdelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyonehave a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables andequipment would weigh?And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discardedto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10engines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? I've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for theDC-1.All in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on themoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the firstnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a mannedmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables fromlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Findsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goalmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appearedto win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scaryabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'dlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was anEnglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases onthe cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the humanbody produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solarflares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine.

What about guys like:Nieminen, Jutila, Riihijarvi, Varvio, Laukkanen, Makela, Keskinen and (evenif he is aging) Ruotsalainen?

1441,"Archive-name: space/astronautLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:02 $HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT    First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA    announcement.    Q. How do I become an astronaut?    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle ""mission    specialist"".    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly    exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.	It is not enough    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in    another seems to be a frequent winner.    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.	(DO NOT get a    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.    Keep your nose clean.    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant ""you    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first"".    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance    to demonstrate motivation.    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.    NASA    National Aeronautics and Space Administration    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center    Houston, Texas    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates    ==================================================================    Astronaut Candidate Program    ---------------------------    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be    considered.    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation    program.    Space Shuttle Program Description    ---------------------------------    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and    flight crew.    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include    government agencies and private industries.    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA    astronauts.    Pilot Astronaut    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other    payload operations.    Mission Specialist Astronaut    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific    experimental operations.    Astronaut Candidate Program    ===========================    Basic Qualification Requirements    --------------------------------    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to    submitting an application.    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable and may be    substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master's    degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). Quality of academic    preparation is important.    2. Ability to pass a NASA class II space physical, which is similar to a    civilian or military class II flight physical and includes the following    specific standards:	 Distant visual acuity:	      20/150 or better uncorrected,	      correctable to 20/20, each eye.	 Blood pressure:	      140/90 measured in sitting position.    3. Height between 58.5 and 76 inches.    Pilot Astronaut Candidate:    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of    academic preparation is important.    2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight    test experience highly desirable.    3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a    military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following    specific standards:	 Distant visual acuity:	      20/50 or better uncorrected	      correctable to 20/20, each eye.	 Blood pressure:	      140/90 measured in sitting position.    4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.    Citizenship Requirements    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of    the United States.    Note on Academic Requirements    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the    sciences, are not considered qualifying:      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,	Medical Technology, etc.)      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological	Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).      - Degrees in Nursing.      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.    Application Procedures    ----------------------    Civilian    The application package may be obtained by writing to:	NASA Johnson Space Center	Astronaut Selection Office	ATTN: AHX	Houston, TX 77058    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as    supervisors and references may be contacted.    Active Duty Military    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application    procedures will be disseminated by each service.    Selection    ---------    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered    will be notified of the outcome of the process.    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following    their establishment.    General Program Requirements    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during    their candidate period.    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a    specified tour of duty.    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.    Pay and Benefits    ----------------    Civilians    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements    and experience.    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and    participation in group health and life insurance plans.    Military    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and    other similar military matters."

If nothing else, I knowsuch liquids ARE possible because...They showed a large glass full of this liquid, and put a white mouse (rat?) init.  Since the liquid was not dense, the mouse would float, so it was held downby tongs clutching its tail.

1482,"Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept.  Itwould be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft.The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one toten megatons yield behind a ""pusher plate"" attached to the mainspacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfermomentum to the ship.  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosionheats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock waveinto the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see aregoing to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagneticradiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fissionproducts).  Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very muchmomentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seemsto me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombsout the back of the ship than you get from detonating them oncethey're there.

1486,"Here at Lewis and Clark College we have recently installed a Digital Filmsystem (based on the Mac Quadra) that does non-linear, full digital editing.If you're considering such a system, here are the pros and cons:For the educational environment, this system is excellent.  We use it toproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our localnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, theimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export thevideo to the Net.We also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs foruse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant forcommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.The Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B rolldigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted asan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the makerof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has beenunable to deliver.  Our system produces ""near VHS"" quality at 30 fields persecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60fields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that somefind distracting.If you can get past this problem, you'll find the Adobe Premier editing software quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands ofdifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.Because of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you've everused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you'll recognize the methodologyand the user interface.The total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21"" Apple mon-itor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),Composite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.For you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a qualitythat will satisfy most of your clients.

I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a prettygood centre - right wing combination, and the Bruins also got Brad Park in thedeal (and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else). After the trade, the Bruins were in two finals and one semi-final, all of which, of course, they lost to Montreal (which should please you to no end).

1508,"It's not a bad question: I don't have any refs that list this algorithmeither. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well asthe circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this centerperpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center ofthe sphere.3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. Thisgives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere'sorigin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center toany of the original points.I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formedby the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains thecenter of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersectingat a point. This might be easier to implement."

Recognizing that most of the military requirementsfor launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSIONNOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter forC programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free to contact me.The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls fromthe FPU version to make it run faster.Those of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.********Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:-------------------------------------Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of drawing three-dimensional scenes? Didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure of three-dimensional molecules?And didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from actually doing it?Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to do with this package???' , read on.GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating (independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallelprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showingoff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explainwhat it all means later on). GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines withdata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routinesto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines soyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.Both versions are *100% source compatibel*. GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3Dgraphics and how to use the package.If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use fora lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed."

1532,"Here are some recent observations taken by the Hubble Space Telescope:     o The Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) was used to make ultraviolet       observations of both the planet Pluto, and its moon Charon. The       peakups were successful. The observations were executed as       scheduled, and no problems were reported.     o Observations were made using the High Speed Photometer of the Planet       Uranus during an occultation by a faint star in Capricornus. These       observations will help in our understanding of the planet's       atmospheric radiative and dynamical processes. This event occurred       close to the last quarter moon, and special arrangements had to be       made to modify the lunar limit tests to allow these observations.       The observations are currently being reviewed, and all the       observations looked okay."
1533,"The problem with Commercial Titan is that MM has made little or no attemptto market it.  They're basically happy with their government business anddon't want to have to learn how to sell commercially.A secondary problem is that it is a bit big.  They'd need to go aftermulti-satellite launches, a la Ariane, and that complicates the marketingtask quite significantly.They also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong timeto get them started properly.  If memory serves, the pad used for the MarsObserver launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that hadprevented launches from it for a year or so.There have been a few CT launches.  Mars Observer was one of them.  Sowas that stranded Intelsat, and at least one of its brothers that reachedorbit properly."

Others claim to be staying of their own freewill, but Jobs' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.In conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflictinginformation on how heavily prepared the group is for war with theindustry.  At times, he has claimed to ""have hardware which will blowanything else away"", while more recently he claims they have stoppedmanufacturing their own.Agents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group isequipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces andpossibly Canon equipment.The siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious toother cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,including a young man who will identify himself only as ""Bill"" andclaims to be the ""MS-iah"".Former members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speakhesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There werefrequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of""interpersonal computing"" which rejects traditional roles.Late-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll onfederal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blaresthroughout the night.

1562,"The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lillyhad with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, andcommercial space.  This is how it went...After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) PattyMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heardthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were notbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talkingto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was anotherwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic thatwe brought up.But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporatealigned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access toLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourismpaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees theatmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smogover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out thatthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to otherfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle businessangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personalcommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs providedin those sectors.Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in orderto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts areproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that theresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts alongthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actuallyhappen immediatly there.The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that weknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that theycould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't knowthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people whoreally did know the answers.Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  Hesaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, thiswould be something that she would be very interested in, although theydo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in thestate 1 week out of 6 these days.All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job."
1563,"These new rule changes are great!  However, I think that your rules areMUCH too complicated.  How will the normal average fan be able to counthow many fouls a player has?  And then we would even have to remember thenames of the players, in order to determine who drew the foul!  And, ofcourse, there will have to be new ""sub-positions"", like the power centerwho just sits in the slot until the (blue, of course) puck comes near him,and the ""shooting defenseman"" and the ""point defenseman"".  Finally, we'llbe able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty-shot takers. Since almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled, we'll be able tosee Ulf Samuellson (sp?) and Tie Domi miss penalty shots like crazy.  ;-) ;-) ;-)--    Keith Keller				LET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!

And the announcers, admittedly homers,kept harping about how they ""must have had a different view upstairs""because it was obvious to them, and, I would have thought, to anyone whosaw the replay, that the puck didn't go in.  The referee originally signalled no goal but the video replay ""judges"" initiated contact withthe referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  This, to me, isunheard of.

1575,"I think you missed one of my points there.  It takes *more* than a greatGM to win a stanley cup, even once.  Some of the guys on the list yougave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argueback and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey-that is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better than yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* originalpost (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but notthe coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:I think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved herewhich transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for us to say, ""He should hire a different coach.""  In fact, he has talked aboutdoing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has sobuilt up this business about Murray never getting past the second round ofthe playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the secondround.  He needs to, as the papers say, ""get that monkey off his back.""So it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolishto let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're alla little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step downfrom behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team willimprove as a result.I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spenton GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see howgood of a GM he really is.I may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussingit with you."

1585,"   As for advertising -- sure, why not?  A NASA friend and I spent one   drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we'd need   to put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization   on the face of the Moon.  Fortunately, we sobered up in the morning.Hmmm. It actually isn't all that much, is it? Like about 2 millionkm^2 (if you think that sounds like a lot, it's only a few tens of m^2per burger that said organization sold last year). You'd be best offwith a reflective substance that could be sprayed thinly by anunmanned craft in lunar orbit (or, rather, a large set of such craft).If you can get a reasonable albedo it would be visible even at newmoon (since the moon itself is quite dark), and _bright_ at full moon.You might have to abandon the colour, though.Buy a cheap launch system, design reusable moon -> lunar orbitunmanned spraying craft, build 50 said craft, establish a lunar baseto extract TiO2 (say: for colour you'd be better off with a sulphurcompound, I suppose) and some sort of propellant, and Bob's youruncle.  I'll do it for, say, 20 billion dollars (plus changes ofidentity for me and all my loved ones). Delivery date 2010.Can we get the fast-food chain bidding against the fizzy-drinkvendors? Who else might be interested?Would they buy it, given that it's a _lot_ more expensive, and notmuch more impressive, than putting a large set of several-kminflatable billboards in LEO (or in GEO, visible 24 hours from yourkey growth market).

1587,"Archive-name: space/probeLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:19 $PLANETARY PROBES - HISTORICAL MISSIONS    This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes    (klaes@verga.enet.dec.com), mostly minor formatting changes. Matthew    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).US PLANETARY MISSIONS    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted    from the expression ""R-dot-bar sub n"" (nth smoothed value of derivative    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary    space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from    this preliminary scan that Mars was a ""dead"" world in both the    geological and biological sense.    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information    that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times    that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface    of an ocean.    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away    the concept of Mars as a ""dead"" planet, first made from the basic    measurements of MARINER 4.    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket    launcher autopilot failed.    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup    images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever    to do so.    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made    the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before    its batteries failed.    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon    and drifted off into solar orbit.    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored    the Tycho crater region in 1968.    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the    engineers' efforts through May of 1983.    An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut    down on April 12, 1980.    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle    is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10    satellites and one more ring were discovered.    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were    discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the    location of the heliopause.SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first	     craft in solar orbit.    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was	     also a test for future Mars missions.    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images	     from surface.    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.    LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.    ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8	     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were	     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.    LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil	      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in	      1972.    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's	      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished	      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in	      1976.    SOVIET VENUS PROBES    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions	       lost enroute in 1961.    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with	       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in	       February of 1966. No images were returned.    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.	       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe	       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending	       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before	       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles	       similar in 1969.    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet	       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in	       1972.    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the	       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar	       mission.    VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.		VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.    VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of		planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.    VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian	     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on	     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in	     March of 1986.    SOVIET MARS PROBES    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased	     enroute the following year.    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian	     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian	     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red	     Planet in 1971.    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander	     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to	     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in	     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.	     probe MARINER 9.    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit	     with its flyby bus.    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest	       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to	       human/computer error.    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did	       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week	       before scheduled Phobos landing.    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their    space program remains to be seen.JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on    January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for    a Japanese spacecraft.    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists    to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March    19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the    approach:	Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km	Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km	Inclination	: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)	Period		: 4.7 daysPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good    public and university library. Some of the more recently published works    can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market    bookstore.    General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):      J. Kelly Beatty et al, THE NEW SOLAR SYSTEM, 1990.      Merton E. Davies and Bruce C.

Other works and periodicals:    NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space    probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry    these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission    you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study    some of the books listed above.    Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL    GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's    Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,    SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER    missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the    VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.    More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions    can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and    SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,    but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events    were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are    affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you    probably know.    Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you    might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their    periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe    missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,    Pasadena, California 91106 USA.    Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I    personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas    in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from    it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

1595,"The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the SpectrumSunday night, and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0shutout. Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely brokea sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs frommounting any serious attack.Injuries:Pelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.Roster Moves:Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERSsecond pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 yearsold, 6'4"", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense inthis game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use himup front as well.Andre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second periodof the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win,and played again for Hershey Sunday night.Lines:Fedyk-Lindros-RecchiBeranek-Brind'Amour-DineenLomakin-Butsayev-ConroyActon-BrownGalley-McGillYushkevich-CroninCarkner-HawgoodBowenTommy Soderstrom in goal.Acton replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.Game Summary:If the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs thisyear. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance afterscoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but insteadof taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side.A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been agoal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance whenhe hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killingunit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. TheMaple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense sweptaway every rebound.After the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amourgave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at thenet. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of JosefBeranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able toget his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating intothe slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa fora 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.The FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERSfrom building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down anddefense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalieswere strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.Then Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he hada chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned intohim, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Folignowas a little far from the boards, and Mike ""Mister"" McGeough felt that itwarranted a boarding call at 15:38The Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS werevery aggressive (for a change) on the kill.With time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zoneand handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were ina crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand passto Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clarkchecked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak andwent right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just insidethe blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his owngoalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuktripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, theFLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Ericgloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. Wecould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his gloveand the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time wasrunning out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goalmouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner whereRecchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,and Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves pastBobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance onthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play witha slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had mostof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempersflared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Actongot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood ahooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood'sstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowskitried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,and just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly asnobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,but Soderstrom stoned him.The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn'tget anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and theydecided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it alittle.The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of theperiod, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros makingroad kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros (unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)all at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.At about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his leftcircle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, andas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towardsit (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or theother). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give theLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstromstoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound throughSoderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was sweptaway by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom wasequal and preserved the shutout.Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawlat 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, KrushelnyskiBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranekexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing toset up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERSzone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ranhis stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.Upward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each gota couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!Penalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowskiand Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interestin stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch untilHawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck andblasted it past Puppa at 18:39.That was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppadid, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Starbreak. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most inthe NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can'tremember that he's tied with.Next up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannotbe eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that nightin Washington would be the official end.FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 pointsin 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is betterthan 5 under in 80).Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5this 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home tolose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERSwill win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tiebreakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumbledown the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, andfinish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be thegoal for the team to focus on.FLYERS team record watch:Eric Lindros:38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points(rookie records)club record goals:			club record points:Eric Lindros	38 1992-93		Dave Poulin	76 1983-84Brian Propp	34 1979-80		Brian Propp	75 1979-80Ron Flockhart	33 1981-82		Ron Flockhart	72 1981-82Dave Poulin	31 1983-84		Eric Lindros	67 1992-93Bill Barber	30 1972-73		Pelle Eklund	66 1985-86Mark Recchi:51 goals, 66 assists, 117 points.club record goals:			club record points:Reggie Leach	61 1975-76		Bobby Clarke	119 1975-76Tim Kerr	58 1985-86,86-87	Mark Recchi	117 1992-93Tim Kerr	54 1983-84,84-85	Bobby Clarke	116 1974-75Mark Recchi	51 1992-93		Bill Barber	112 1975-76Rick Macliesh	50 1972-73		Bobby Clarke	104 1972-73Bill Barber	50 1975-76		Rick Macliesh	100 1972-73Reggie Leach	50 1979-80FLYERS career years:Player		Points	Best Prior SeasonMark Recchi	117	113 (90-91 Penguins)Rod Brind'Amour	79	77 (91-92 FLYERS)Garry Galley	58	38 (84-85 Kings)Brent Fedyk	58	35 (90-91 Red Wings)That's all for now..."

Remember these:- Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons)- Nicholls ... in Edmonton.- R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only.- C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year.I know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more:- Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french  fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities.  One  players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could  not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal.Anybody knows what happened when all these US football players movedto London, Spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league(2 years ago?)I wonder what the players association thinks about going to Europe.Myself I would like to see some European teams, but what would be the best way to do it?

1607,"The first time I heard this piece of news was on the post game radiointerview here in Jyvaskyla. That was the bronze medal game in the SM-liiga which Tichonov's team Porin Assat (the Aces of town Pori:)lost.  Vasili, the son of Victor Tichonov (the famous Soviet coach),said that for a long time the Sharks have been persuading him totake the assistant coach post. But he wants to be the head coach whereever he goes. He definitely won't be coaching Assat anymore (afterthree? seasons). I don't know why.Vasili is a good coach I believe. Assat was a good team, produced manyplayers to our national team. Assat wasn't a skilled team (IMHO) butthey had the fighting spirit. After all, they butchered Jokerit in theplayoffs and gave hard time to TPS, the champs. But Assat wasn'tconsistent, only when they were in the right mood they could beat anyteam in the SM-liiga.I am not 100% sure about the deal with the Sharks. As I said, he wantsto be the head coach. But he and the Sharks are going to negotiate anddecide during the WC. I doubt that he will be the head coach butmaybe they'll do some compromise."

1622,"Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, theirERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressivestrength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,therefore the theoretical height for a constant section columnthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,or 75 Statute miles.Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a trusstype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.Let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constantsection column.  A constant section column is not the limit on how high you canbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross sectionas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 poundload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity incalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column crosssectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structurebelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.The next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross sectionto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mileof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the wayto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoreticallimit on area, although there will be practical limits basedon how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and howmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you needa foundation that the bedrock can support.Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costructioncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figureis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload massratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the towerheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significantatmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will stillhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losseswill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component ofrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thusthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets startingfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider windloads.  These will require more structural support over the first15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a lowenough value for it not to be a big factor.Dani Eder"

(I'm a littlefuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAM/VRAM capacity).It was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the Electronic Cafe inSanta Monica, CA. From 3DO, RJ Mical (of Amiga/Lynx fame) and HalJosephson (sp?) were there to talk about the machine and their plan. Wegot to see the unit displaying full-screen movies using the CompactVideo codec(which was nice, very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft)... and a very high frame rate to boot (like 30fps).Note however that the 3DO's screen resolution is 320x240.CompactVideo is pretty amazing... I also wanted to point out that QuickTimedoes indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was statedabove... I'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large sizethen it would play back fine (I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit). Theprice of generality... personally I don't use the dynamic sizing of moviesoften, if ever. But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quickon the latest 040 machines.I'm not sure how a Centris/20MHz 040 stacks up against the 25 MHz ARM inthe 3DO box. Obviously the ARM is faster, but how much?"

1636,"I was at an interesting seminar at work (UK's R.A.L. Space ScienceDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sailproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen togenerate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out atthe meeting. Here goes : 			The Microlight Solar Sail			-------------------------1. IntroductionThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure ofsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such avehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than mostpeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram persquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminizedfabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' typespacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hteidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.2.DesignRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: atiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purelybe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude controlmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on apanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed atEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and datagathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control andcommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surfaceof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost ofthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.3.MissionsThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amorgroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bitrate.b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobservedareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail toreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receivesunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm thatvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in theselocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunarbase, BTW]c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or cometnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craftcauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edgedtube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as anideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heatis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulatingcontainer.Contact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447Oxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England--------------------------------This guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project orseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you moreinformation.

1652,"Actually, Hiten wasn't originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all,so it indeed didn't have much fuel on hand.  The lunar-orbit mission wasan afterthought, after Hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hitenduring a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertioninto lunar orbit couldn't be positively confirmed.It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takesa long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit.If you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit, you do haveto plan to expend a certain amount of fuel, although it is reduced fromwhat you'd need for the brute-force approach."

I'll alsotell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on.Other things to watch out for/consider:	The rates are $5 to $30 higher than UPS direct.	For a non-UPS (truck) package, they quoted a rate	of $85. Fed Ex economy air was only $85 for the	same weight! RPS (a trucking package company, in many	cities) only wanted $18. Guess who got it. The Mailbox	operator told me I was not telling the truth about	competitors' rates, said RPS was unreliable (I've used them	before with NO problems), etc. Right.	A COD check goes to the mailing service. Our local	Mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the	remade check. All this for an additional $3.00 over the	UPS COD charge. What a deal.... :-)	For packages over $100, they charge you about double over	what UPS charges them for insurance. I've never had	a claim, but other netters (is Ralph Seguin out there?)	have told horror stories about them...	All package traces have to be done through Mailbox by	Mailbox.	Our local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I	asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared	to direct UPS. Does he ever check? Probably not...	Their UPS ground rates come close to Fed Ex's economy	air rate, and Fed Ex will pick up!

Roger, on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that hiswas a ""jingoistic rant"", but you also supported the name-changing on thegrounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individualsthey represent. FWIW, I do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do I think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.  Just an observation...However, that aside, the real question is whether you like the idea ofchanging the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier forthe 'casual fan'), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional namesbased on individuals who do deserve the honour.  IMO, the latter is a niceand unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition, I do notthink that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number ofpeople that are interested in hockey, so it's a pointless exercise anyway.If the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not central to the original article.  Something to consider additionally iswhether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport'would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league toplay in.  In this case, honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed tobuilders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question.

1673,"LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics               Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists           CLAIM to be looking for a ""Unified Field Theory"" in which all           of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single           set of laws or equations.  But they have been systematically           IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he           calls the ""Reciprocal System"", is built on two fundamental           postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of           space and time:                    (1) ""The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE           component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE           UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.""                    (2) ""The physical universe conforms to the relations of           ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are           ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.""                    From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE           Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of           translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward           SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light           (which Larson called ""UNIT VELOCITY"" and ""THE NATURAL           DATUM"").                      At each step in the development, Larson was able to           MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the           REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles           [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star           clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white           dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET           DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY           BURSTS).                          And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,           Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility           and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of           matter.

Box 13255, Portland, OR  97213, and           should be available via inter-library loan if your local           university or public library doesn't have each of them.

This is the           organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.            They have other related publications, including the quarterly           journal ""RECIPROCITY"".                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background                   Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer           (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he           died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in           Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He           developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE           chemical properties based only on the elements used.                    Larson's lack of a fancy ""PH.D."" degree might be one           reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is           NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider           to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same           time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX           physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,           well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC           ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                     Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally           test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.            He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER           researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in           many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                    A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX           physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking           for a ""unified field theory"" that works, but have been           IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                    ""Modern physics"" does NOT explain the physical universe           so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of           quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who           agree.  And remember that ""epicycles"", ""crystal spheres"",           ""geocentricity"", ""flat earth theory"", etc., ALSO once SEEMED           to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                        Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,           was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or           still is) President of Larson's organization, ""THE           INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE"", and Editor of           their quarterly Journal ""RECIPROCITY"".  He moved to           Minneapolis after retiring.               ""Super Collider"" BOONDOGGLE!                         I am AGAINST contruction of the ""Superconducting Super           Collider"", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS           WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of ""scientific""           value.                    Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the           comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist           Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY           particles (""mesons"", ""hyperons"", ALLEGED ""quarks"", etc.)           which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,           Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are           CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly           disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible           with their environment.                    A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a           few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not           seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE           CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                    Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3           BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for           this WASTED money?!                         Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed           location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some           kind of ""fire ants"" eating the insulation off underground           cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water           with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of           the ""Supercollider""?!                              Naming the ""Super Collider"" after Ronald Reagon, as           proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be           named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                 LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                         In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of           opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more           to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the           photons of which they are made, in relation to the           vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,           which Larson calls ""Unit Velocity"" and the ""Natural Datum"".                     In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of           MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,           the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their           respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each           other.                      In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical           universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension           of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our           MATERIAL half.                  LARSONIAN Relativity                         The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury           has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the           rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this           advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational           perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,           etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to           help ""prove"" Einstein's ""General Theory of Relativity"".                    But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results           CLOSER to the 43 seconds than ""General Relativity"" can, by           INSTEAD using ""SPECIAL Relativity"".  In one or more of his           books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH           ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                    Larson TOTALLY REJECTED ""General Relativity"" as another           MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of ""Special           Relativity"", including the parts about ""mass increases"" near           the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on           doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than           1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,           although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                     In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead           of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured           from our material half of the physical universe.  The one           dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low           relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are           NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and           the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.           [Larson often used the term ""COORDINATE TIME"" when writing           about this.]                         In regard to ""mass increases"", it has been PROVEN in           atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near           the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is           ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists           are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,           mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is           actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS           BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.            The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward           SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of           the so-called ""Big Bang"" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL           FANTASY).                                                             THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book ""THE UNIVERSE           OF MOTION"", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific           Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456           pages, indexed, hardcover.                    It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL           UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that           author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                    It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical           mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and           multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of           the ""3-degree"" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white           dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                    It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL           looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with           OPEN MINDS!                    The following is an example of his Theory's success:           In his first book in 1959, ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL           UNIVERSE"", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING           GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding           them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's           comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he           had an immediate related explanation for them also.                GAMMA-RAY BURSTS               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching           their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were           originally thought to originate from ""neutron stars"" in the           disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in           Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions           uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT           correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of           directional coincidence).                    Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by           the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of           his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", published in 1984, the           gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the           ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls           the ""Cosmic Sector"".  Because of the relationship between the           anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and           the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can           pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at           random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do           not correspond with known objects, and come from all           directions uniformly.)                    I wonder how close to us in space a source location           would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most           life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to           stop it!                    Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which           are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were           actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!               LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                         About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the           vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox           astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory           theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                    But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY           CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of           the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey           B. Larson.                    I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is           detailed in Chapter 7 of his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION""           and in some of his other books.                    First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate           energy by ""fusion"".  A small fraction comes from slow           gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE           ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each           element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the           element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal           temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and           absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually           reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and           lighter elements.                    When the internal temperature of the star reaches the           destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I           SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron           present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms           and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some           of his books [better than I can].                    When the star explodes, the lighter material on the           outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less           than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center           portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to           the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The           explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and           it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN           SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                    Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall           back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown           outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The           material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a           WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward           the ""MAIN SEQUENCE"" from opposite directions on the H-R           Diagram.                    The chances of the two masses falling back into the           exact same location in space, making a single lone star           again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY           system, orbiting each other.                     According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE           DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the           material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown           outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to           MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about ""degenerate matter"", ""neutron           stars"", ""black holes"", etc..               LARSONIAN Solar System Formation               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the           exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single           white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL ""mini"" white dwarf           stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably           still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected           by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                      In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all           this information, and other principles of his comprehensive           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive           his own version of Bode's Law.                     ""Black Hole"" FANTASY!               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently           completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO ""black           holes"" merging together into a SINGLE ""black hole"", and           concluded that the new ""black hole"" would have MORE MASS than           the sum of the two original ""black holes"".                    Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED           FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of ""black           holes"", etc.!                    After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about           his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe, especially his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", it is           clear to me that ""black holes"" are NOTHING more than           MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is           just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the ""black           hole"" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want           to ""prove"" their theory.                        By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is           being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and           astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical           problem somehow makes him ""wiser"".  It does NOT!                    I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist           Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread           publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's           Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of           Unified Science).                                         ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection           with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to           find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                    I found a possible clue about why they might work on           pages 112-113 of the book ""BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER"", by           the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of           Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe.  I quote one paragraph:                    ""As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development           of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally           different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.            The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It           was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book ""NOTHING BUT           MOTION""] that there are physical processes in operation which           produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,           although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in           many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities           for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are           limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of           free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the           universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged           state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension           space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,           and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open           space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently           in the same location with respect to the natural reference           system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the           stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,           like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by           the progression of the natural reference system.  All           material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons           similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.            Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,           whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The           electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth           therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.""                          Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are           also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a           particular frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) spinning           around one axis at a particular rate (below the ""unit"" rate).            (""Unit velocity"" is the speed of light, and there are           vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,           according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the ""above"" and           ""below"" labels mixed up.]                    Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of           light!                    If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION           fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these           electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a           charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to           achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge           is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular           frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) superimposed on the           rotation of the particle.)                      The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to           confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is           generated in clouds.           SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has           been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in           his first book ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE"".                    It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,           and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call           ""science"" (or ""physics"", or ""astronomy"", etc.), as well as           the ""scientific"" literature and the ""education"" systems, to           TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have.                    Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many           things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such           as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                    Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY           discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,           in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles           of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses           at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and           elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a           worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

1675,"#21	PETER AHOLA		Season: 2ndAcquired:	'92-93, trade with Pittsburgh for future considerationsGrade:		I (B)It is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because thePenguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola hadonly played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San JoseMercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games hehas played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't beenspectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points);it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turnout to be ... Peter Ahola.#24	DOUG WILSON		Season: 16thAcquired:	'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and		2nd round pick in '92 entry draftGrade:		I (B)I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too highexpectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting andplaymaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow tocatch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may beWilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.#29	DEAN KOLSTAD		Season:	2ndAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:		I (C-/D+)It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful ofgames (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he'squickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period ofthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here withthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkwardwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap inhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team.#38	PAT MACLEOD		Season: 2ndAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:		I (?)MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to mymemory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant touse him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring thathe wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks withKansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,a ""rehab assignment"" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, buthe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensiveskills.#41	TOM PEDERSON		Season: 1stAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:		I (B+)Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimatedby injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yourstruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in43 games.  However, his size (5' 9"", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon afterhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chanceon surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.#45	CLAUDIO SCREMIN		Season: 1stAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:		I (D+/D)He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughlyumimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be asmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, isquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense ordefense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing thatwill go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that hewas once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre."

1696,"Tom Barrasso wore a great mask, one time, last season.  He unveiled itat a game in Boston.  It was all black, with Pgh city scenes on it.  The ""Golden Triangle""(Pgh's downtown area where the 3 rivers meet) graced the top, alongwith a steel mill on one side and the Civic Arena (I think) on the other.   On the back of the helmet was the old Pens' logo (the reallyfat little penguin with the blue scarf) the current (at the time) Penslogo, and a space for the ""new"" (now current) logo.Tommy had designed the mask, and his mother (an artist) painted itfor him.

1707,"Here is a summary of Don Cherry's coach's corner from April 18, 1993.It took place in the first intermission of game 1 of the Montreal-Quebecseries. Pre-game comments-----------------Don's pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... The goaliewho gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the seriesfor his team.Eposode Summary---------------This episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog thathe bought from the concession stand.Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in theToronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadowand proclaimed ""Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeksof me. Beauty.""Next, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According tohim, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in allthe arenas in the NHL.From there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The gamehad great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best gamein the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... Allstop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgaryby Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the mostpenalties gets to ref in the finals.Next, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing forthe Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of thewins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cupand the AHL championships.Finally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of theRangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved.Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who hadseveral key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies whowent cold.Don had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party's over,Adolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longerbe a 'country club'.... ""NY should be achamed of themselves... Ifthey go in the tank with Adolf there, they'll be hanging from theyardarm by their thumbs.""Rating------Nothing too special in this episode.I'll give it a 5.5 out of 10.------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \  \                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)    \  \                  |Department of Computing Science,     \  \_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.      \    ###  \     _   |---------------------------------------------------       \___###___\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.------------------------------------------------------------------------------""It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the credit...""          - U. of A.

They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to havesome. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbitalprototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive foranother year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (withmajor modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for aset of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers ofthis program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M nextyear for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.Now not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be madefor spending half on DC.Public support is STILL critical.

If  youasked  somone,  who  had never heard of hockey before, if LA played inthe Smythe division what do you think  that  the  response  would  be?What  if you asked this person if LA played in the West division?  Thenaming of  divisions  after  long-dead  entrepreneurs  is  unnecessaryobfuscation.Hardly.  The ""established"" situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al.The  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever teamcould successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  didwas formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop-olistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth-er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainlydebatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de-bate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made, however, is that peopleplayed hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smytheand his pals showed up.What's wrong with best defenceman, period?  Was there  ever  a  betterdefenceman?   Was  there  ever a better player?

1733,"I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no meansinfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is granted to copy this without restriction.Note for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing asingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled ""Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions"" here at the University ofIllinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories anddetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he isnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the detailsof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hopethey aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you willbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  Themain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume thatthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but Idid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boostersand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelsonshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:                  ______3 G         /|   /      |           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly           /  | /        |	   good.  The big difference is that the lines2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as       /                |          the graph wasn't up for very long.1 G   /                 |                        |                        |0 G                     |             ^          ^           ~100 sec    ~400 secAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel theaccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so itsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer enginesbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cutout entirely.The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimedfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges ofair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to that desired.Questions from the audience:  (paraphrased)Q:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than    all at once?A:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.Q:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?A:  Can't tell us.  ""Read Aviation Leak.""  He also apparently had a good     propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protectingnational security or MD protecting their own interests?The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitchup maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphsof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would haveabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about 60 degrees south latitude.I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about thataspect of the flight profile."

1735,"The problem is, you can't raise adequate amounts of money that way.The Viking Fund tried.  They did succeed, in a way, but only becauseof the political impact of their fundraising.

It was kind ofawkward, but Melrose appointed (anointed?)

1742,"Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of   doing this.  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading   this group, from code to hardware to algorithms.  I just think making 5   different groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts   a week per group.  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum   for discussing all aspects of graphics.  Anyone else feel this way?   Just curious.I disagree.  You could learn the same amount by reading all thesplit groups, and it would make things easier for those of uswho are less omnivorous.  There is no ""waste"" in creating newsgroups -- its just a bit of shuffling about.  I have no problemwith only a few posts per week per group - I spend too much timeon this as it is."

Has anyone done better?The year before he took over, the Wings didn't even make the playoffs.There was about a year and a half during Demers' stint that the Wingsdid OK, but that was due to Demers' motavational skills and clutchand grab style.

1756,"Well, since the Oilers didn't win a heck of a lot of games, I'm not surethey deserve and MVP (""can't win without him"").  However, I'd suggest KellyBuchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick forthe All-Star game notwithstanding.As for biggest surprise, I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectationsthis year due to his ""breakthrough"" year (for him) last year, so he didn'treally raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of thecallups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on thedepth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact onthe team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decentnumbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-leagueoblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli.I think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.As for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilersdumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) oreven Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.-- Andrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.comHP IDACOM Telecom Division      | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253"

1762,"Buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains.Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forcedto give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from MikeFoligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from LindyRuff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, whoretired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it?After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit.Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, inreverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'mnot sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroitand Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smithseems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know ifthe captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games heplayed for Buffalo.

1763,"Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power.  Whengraphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft,presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) thearea on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraftdoesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational)envelope'. Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actuallyflies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there areare the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilotsdo for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close thecorrespondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- inessence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to wherethe airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this isdone is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generallycarefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and howfar is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans,such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speedtaxi tests).I'm sure Mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know aboutthis process (and then some).-- ""Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world.""   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden"

1811,"I've been following discussions about the Delta Clipper program, and Ihave one small question.  As I understand it, the DC-X derived orbitalvehicle (DC-Y & 1) is to reenter the atmosphere sort of sideways, notcompletely nose-first.  So why is the DC-Y look symmetric in every drawingI've seen?  I would think that an asymmetric design, sort of like wingless Orbiter, may work better, since less shielding is required on thetop side.  Can anybody explain?  - Ken Kobayashikkobayas@husc.harvard.edu-- "
1812,"We are not at the end of the Space Age, but only at the end of Itsbeginning.That space exploration is no longer a driver for technical innovation,or a focus of American cultural attention is certainly debatable; however,technical developments in other quarters will always be examined forpossible applications in the space area and we can look forward tomany innovations that might enhance the capabilities and lower thecost of future space operations.

1813,"Re Eric: True, but fortunately we didn't get to find out what they would belike without Recchi for 30 games.Soderstrom: Absolutely. 4 shutouts in 39 games for a rookie without a lotof defense in front of him. Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoringa ton over their career best. But Galley thinks he's Paul Coffey (puts scoringahead of defending) and Fedyk has tailed off big time.Eklund: Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42points in 49 games is not bad at all, and recently he's been a huge factorin the wins they've gotten. Eklund has never had a point a game season inhis career, his production is very typical for him. How does he qualify asa disappointment? If anything he's a surprise.My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players,but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. My biggestdisappointment is Bill Dineen. I thought that he was going to be the perfectcoach for this young team, instead he's made too many bad moves and IMHOhas cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year. Anycoach that thinks putting Eric Lindros at the point on power plays is abright idea needs to go back to coaching school."

1817,"No.  That's *not* what I was complaining about, nor did I intend tosuggest that DEC was any better than SGI (let me tell you about theLynx some day, but be prepared with a large sedative if you do...).  Mycomment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendorsthat supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI.What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe thatwe *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of theCrimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.I'm also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at aprevious site on the understanding *that* architecture would be aroundfor a while, rather than being flushed.Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has tokeep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myselfpressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the booksjust before the end of the quarter), but I'm just a little tired ofgetting boned in the process.Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so wearen't entitled to a ""peek under the covers"" as the Big Kids (NASA,for instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labsand organizations, doesn't have a load of money to spend on computersevery year, so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis.The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through theentire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond.

1818,": you mention could cut it as stars in the NHL! Even ""Rexi"" in his prime was more: of a good regular in New York/Edmonton than a superstar in his own right,: although some blamed that on lack of effort on his behalf.:I think that the NY management made a mistake, and remember how Edmonton called Reksa in the middle of the season to win the cup ? Why did they callhim? : Yeah, we've had a tendency to beat ourselves in the past. I almost knifed my: brother in anger when Sweden scored two in the final minute of the WC : semifinals back in 1986:-) Or what about the three goals Antero Kivela let in: with five minutes to go against the Russkies in Lake Placid'80? Ugh . . . O.K., that was BAD luck. If Penguins have the same kind of luck this year inthe playoffs, they'll never win the cup. They are still the best team."
1821,"So in other words, if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts outthe Penguins, that's immaterial because it was the coaches decision? Come on,Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant.Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teamsis better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing twogoaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against goodteams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the contextof comparing two goaltenders.YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how youget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're acoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, youhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Torontogame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing inthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The samefor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made agreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. Ifyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goaliestand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Rousseldoesn't have a game like that in him.Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing aboutRoussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seenat least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he wasto have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah,Dom has played well too.FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out ateam picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was thesame picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning,Kasper...Mostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certainautographs on the team photos. I don't like that method since I've seenguards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if theygot their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies."

1826,"[Please, note the Newsgroups.]Recent discussion about XV's problems were held in some newsgroup.Here is some text users of XV might find interesting.I have added more to text to this collection article, so read on, evenyou so my articles a while ago.I hope author of XV corrects those problems as best he can, so fineprogram XV is that it is worth of improving.(I have also minor ideas for 24bit XV, e-mail me for them.)Any misundertanding of mine is understandable.Juhana Kouhia==clip==[ ..deleted..]Note that 'xv' saves only 8bit/rasterized images; that means thatthe saved jpegs are just like jpeg-to-gif-to-jpeg quality.Also, there's three kind of 8bit quantizers; your final image qualitydepends on them too. This were the situation when I read jpeg FAQ a while ago. IMHO, it is design error of 'xv'; there should not be such confusingerrors in programs.There's two errors:  -xv allows the saving of 8bit/rasterized image as jpeg even the   original is 24bit -- saving 8bit/rasterized image instead of   original 24bit should be a special case  -xv allows saving the 8bit/rasterized image made with any quantizer   -- the main case should be that 'xv' quantizes the image with the   best quantizer available before saving the image to a file; lousier   quantizers should be just for viewing purposes (and a special cases   in saving the image, if at all) ==clip====clip==[ ..deleted..]It is limit of *XV*, but not limit of design.It is error in design.It is error that 8bit/quantized/rasterized images are stored as jpegs;jpeg is not designed to that.As matter of fact, I'm sure when XV were designed 24bit displays wereknown. It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images onlyat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program thewhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.That were not done and now we have -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format) -the program has human interface errors.Otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format withoutclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.[ ..deleted.. ]==clip==Some new items follows.==clip==I have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24option than with default option we have.The reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)the same than used in ppmquant.If you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I foundthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.I don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.So, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.I suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used inrlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so Ican say nothing about it.)==clip====clip==Some minor bugs in human interface are:Key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happensthat I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrongplace. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come aboutfive minutes and then it is gone away immediately.The buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.Also, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboardand mouse for XV after the image is completed.Often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just whenI'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressingsthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.In the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XVupdates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values firstand then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to beupdated when the setting are not ready yet.I suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done."

1842,"Here is a review of some of the off-ice things that haveaffected the AHL this year.ST JOHN'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMSThe St John's Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued byproblems. On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title butoff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced theleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half ofthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played ""home"" games in placeslike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff ""home""games will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. Onedemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus androcked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium.Despite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafswill return to St John's once the strike ends.===================================================SENATORS SOLDThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman tothe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only CanadianNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clearthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian AtlanticProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHLhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meetingin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it clear the league was more interested in the stability of the AHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintainingthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. The Senators are currently in serious negotiations with CharlottetownNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.==================================================DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTONAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation outof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashingtheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and theywanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawksin the New Brunswick city.The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years ifthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold1400 for this year.============================================================SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIALThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city ofSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200Exhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansionfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.=========================================================CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINEDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the BaltimoreSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announceda limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so playersincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limitedfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.======================================================AHL GAME OF THE WEEKIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, producedby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the CanadianMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games ofthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, therehas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered andshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, AtlanticSports Network in Canada (but I'm not sure about that). I am notsure if playoff games will be covered.=====================================================UTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?There were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around nextseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwesterncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.=====================================================WHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEARONE OPTION				ANOTHER OPTION			Northern Division			Southern DivisionADIRONDACK RED WINGS			ADIRONDACKSPRINGFIELD INDIANS			SPRINGFIELDPROVIDENCE BRUINS			PROVIDENCECD ISLANDERS				CDIPORTLAND PIRATES			HERSHEY					BINGHAMTONSouthern Division			ROCHESTERHERSHEY BEARS				HAMILTONBINGHAMTON RANGERS			UTICAROCHESTER AMERICANSHAMILTON CANUCKS			Atlantic DivisionUTICA (?)

1843,"Dennis, I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millionsof $$. Customers included government (including NASA), for profit andnon-profit companies. All expected a wrap (usually called a fee). Muchof the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors.The subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, andeven some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALLcharged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASAcommercialization centers; they charge a fee.Now, I'm sure your a competent engineer Dennis, but you clearly lackexperience in several areas. Your posts show that you don't understandthe importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lackof understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that itis reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isn'ta flame, jsut a statement.Your employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.Well there you are Dennis. As I said, they simply include the fee intheir overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure canchange depending on the customer.Integration, Dennis, isn't overhead.Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. WhenWP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much wheredoing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was theonly place you would find people actually interested in solving theproblems and building a station.When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize thatintegration isn't overhead. It is the single most important partof a successful large scale effort.The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it onCongress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centersyou support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't addressthe problems until the press published the story.Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to addressthe overruns? You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?You should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs forresuply. That comes from the Shuttle budget. What they where sayingis that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport.I do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong ofReston to ask that the problems with WP 02 be addressed.

1844,"Hi everyone,I thought that some people may be interested in my VRsoftware on these groups:*******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******Multiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Realitysystem, primarily focused on entertainment/research.Features:   Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.   No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).   Generic clients.   Customizable servers.   Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).   Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).   Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily        attached.Functionality:  Client:   The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to   other users.   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)    o User Interface Panels    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for	faster frame rates)    o Mouse and Keyboard Input   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)  Server(s):   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is   provided in this release for potential world server developers:    o Transparent Client Management    o Client Message Handling   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache ofaccepting and   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - theapplication writer   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension        initialisers you want.    o Event Handler Registration:        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)    o Collision Detection Registration:        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide        some basic information to the collision detection management software.        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects    from which to choose.    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:    o Provide an initWorld function:        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus        any initialization you want to do.    o Provide a positionObject function:        This is where you determine where to place a new client.    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.    o Provide a getWorldType function:        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.    o Provide an animateWorld function:        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit        (to avoid outrunning the clients).    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the    three world servers I've provided:        generic - 81 lines        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future                           versions)        dogfight - 72 linesLocation:   This software is located at the following site:   ftp.u.washington.edu   Directory:   pub/virtual-worlds   File:   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.ZFutures:   Client:    o Texture mapping.    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading    o HMD support.    o Etc, etc....   Server:    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction    o Etc, etc....   Both:    o Improved Comms!!!I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiversesoftware,unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not surewhether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations ofthe Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and Iwould *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!Finally one major disclaimer:This is totally amateur code.

Maine's first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game.LSSU came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2-1.LSSU came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards.The play went quickly with the refs running a no-holds-barred type of game.LSSU scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4-2 at the end of the second.Now it looked like LSSU might just walk away with the game.Coach Walsh, of Maine, replaced the starting goalie Dunham with Snow, who wonthe game against Michigan.  Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie.The third period, like the second, belonged to the team behind.  Maine scoredthree unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark.They were all scored by Jim Montgomery, the tournament MVP, and all assisted byPaul Kariya.The last minute of the game bears highlighting.  The change to Snow alsoproved the difference in the end.  With one minute to go and with the LSSUgoalie pulled, Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves byboth.  Snow won.

I wonder if there might be some way of structuring a contest to encouragelow cost payload delivery systems.  The accounting methods would probablybe the hardest to work out.  For example, would you allow Rockwell to'loan' you the engines?  And so forth...This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line.  In otherwords, perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support,navigation, etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system.

You'd only be displaying your ignorance of course, but to each his own...I think Gainey should feel honoured to know that he is remembered at all.Certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team.

1886,"	I am puzzled by the term ""concept."" Drag free may already havebeen flown. It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that wouldmore accurately respond to motions from the Earth's gravity field andignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ballfloating between sensors whose job it was to signal to littleadjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. The ball itself wouldthen be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravityanisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuouslyadjusting its position to compensate for drag."
1887,"   My understanding is that the 'expected errors' are basically   known bugs in the warning system software - things are checked   that don't have the right values in yet because they aren't   set till after launch, and suchlike. Rather than fix the code   and possibly introduce new bugs, they just tell the crew   'ok, if you see a warning no. 213 before liftoff, ignore it'.Good grief. And I thought the Shuttle software was known for beingwell-engineered. If this is actually the case, every member of theprogramming team should be taken out and shot.(given that I've heard the Shuttle software rated as Level 5 inmaturity, I strongly doubt that this is the case)."
1888,"It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at leasta reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very shortdescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,feel free to poke me via e-mail.================================================================*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.   Consider deleting these edges.1) Now, there are two goals:    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s)       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured        using the digitized (x,y)'s).2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For   example:    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the       Reference(x,y).     b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge       the correct length (where ""correct"" is the DigitizedLength).        Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Considerhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insiston the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want tobalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in lengthof the edges.WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must beobserved (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, andyou can't allow triangles to ""fold over"" neighboring triangles.  Both ofthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion ofindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from theoriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time wasprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try andchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have morecompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider havingevery point interact with every other point....but first read up onlinear solutions to the n-body problem.There are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings onsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

How many opticalastronomers are *really* going to be impacted?	3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data thesensors are supposed to return along with the data for largeinflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)?The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising isbeing used to help fund this thing.	4) If your answer to 3) above was ""the astronomers"", then feelfree to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) moreimportant research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDINGANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.  In other words, put up or shut up.Probably so.  I'm just not sure we agree about who the 'stupid' are. Yeah, me too.-- ""Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world.""   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden"

He workshard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone tocostly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically anoffensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressedto make the team next year.#3	DAVID WILLIAMS		Season: 2ndAcquired:	'91-92, free agent from New JerseyGrade:		C/C-IMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92,playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) andgood defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,was good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, hewas prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate theplaymaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen lastyear.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.#4	JAYSON MORE		Season: 2ndAcquired:	'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draftGrade:		B+After being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training campbefore '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was notparticularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,proceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's mostreliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to playsteady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.Offensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73games), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as thedefensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.#5	NEIL WILKINSON		Season: 4thAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:		B-Wilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However,partially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25games total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowedeven when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;that is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and ifhe can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.#6	SANDIS OZOLINSH		Season: 1stAcquired:	'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draftGrade:		I (A)At the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),Ozolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injuryin that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),but he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points),which, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had fromtheir defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, hewas playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was stillsusceptible to so-called ""rookie mistakes,"" but was probably the defenseman whomade the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come backfrom his injuries, he is ready to be a star.#19	DOUG ZMOLEK		Season: 1stAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:		BZmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharksto play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, butafter being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points).He was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on theteam; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing toughphysical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But tobecome a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively anddefensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents."

It uses few calculations however, basically it is severalcomparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after thetransformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on thescreen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  Mymethod basically figures out whether the points that will appear on thescreen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back ofsomething, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, somerely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you arelooking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.

It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) billsto fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would bespent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of fundinghigh-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund variousfields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to thedefense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC tofund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-Europeancooperation.Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste ofmoney (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count asinvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look atthe size of that multiplier :->)."

1941,"Wales Conference, Adams Division, SemifinalI'm hoping for a Fuhr miracle, but I agree that Boston will likely win theseries.  Goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal(Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau), but Buffalo has no answer to Neely(not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's oneof my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin :) ).  And the rest of thematchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway.  But I think it will go six.Agreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, ordoes everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!FinalI can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to playin the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clearterritorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can'tbring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I willnot be putting money on this series. :-)Agreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independentof the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which iscredit to NY.Agreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decentteam, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.I think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don'tthink it will go six either...*maybe* five.If Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  Theyown the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and onceagain I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because theHabs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.Chicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good,IMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.Very true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find outwhy Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three at MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.It _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all. And yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.Our first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use theirsize *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a teamchasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.This is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough. I don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is anon-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimateGretzky.  LA in six.If it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will beLA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.Wow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I pickedLA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.If Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't betagainst the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strongbecause they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose,though, I'd have to take the Penguins.A side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player thanGilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside fromthe age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team.I'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough timearguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But whilehe and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),Gilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.from Flame fans.

Note the early use ofPostScript technology, predating many of this year's papers listed in theApril 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.-- EricIntersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),	by Dave Baraff, Tom Duff	From: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu	Newsgroups: comp.graphics	Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem	Organization: Program of Computer GraphicsI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines andpolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number ofpoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, theJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane intoexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line liescompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.Now, the phrasing of this question says ""if a line intersects a polygon"", sothis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) isto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try tosolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in anew language called PostScript.  (See ""PostScript Language"", by Adobe SystemsIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program thatdraws the line L and the polygon P, and then ""outputs"" the answer.  By""output"", we mean the program executes a command called ""showpage"", whichactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quickexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thusthe original problem.There are two small problems with this approach. 	(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the	reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of	Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of	Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.	(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the	PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in	other words, will it halt?	Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a	Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is	undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn	out to be undecidable.I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finiteprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.A couple of references might be:1.

By the well knownDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced toHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin anacronym) is probably only NP-complete.

Since this isthe version that launched Mir and the Salyuts (and the add-on modules for Mir),as long as Centaur is smaller than Mir (which I believe it is), it should fitunder the shroud.I vaguely recall that the Russians are developing a LH2/LOX upper stage for theProton."

When   >you add to that Jagr's better +/- rating, I think it becomes evident   >that Jagr had a better season- not that Francis had a bad one.   >     Actually, what I think has become more evident, is that you are determined to     flaunt your ignorance at all cost.  Jagr did not have a better season than     Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of     hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty     plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.     Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice     time per game and some measure of its ""quality"" (i.e., is the player put out     in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up     against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would     much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious     merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up thefact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure youthat I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/-comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyonewould argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-wayplay.In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being askedto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that hecan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top centeris a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On theother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.(By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazyfloater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- likeovertime of playoff games)."

Having said that,I will say PITT in 6.BOS  vs MON:  BOS  in 6.MON will not be there.  BOS is surprising me of late. Cam is great.The couple of wins against QUE last week have sold me with theB's.  B's in 6.CHI  vs DET:  CHI  in 7.Yikes.  This will not be pretty.  But DET is running like a machineof late.  They've had a non-busy end of the season in which they playedlike killers.

1987,"I haven't seen any speculation about it. But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau) was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boostpayload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competingwith the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except nowI recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the earlyresults are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in Russia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue their development. The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton is 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-Dwhich sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know aboutlaunch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches whichare probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake thingsup pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragilething and may require integration on the pad which is not available now.Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support whilebolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road trackand erected on the pad?  They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of courseany Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from theUS at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are politicalproblems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention. "

1990,"I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the operations section of NASA was talking about what future missionswere going to be funded.  I don't remember his name or title off handand I have discarded the colloquia announcement. In any case, he was asked about that very matter: ""Why can't we spend a few million moreto keep instruments that we already have in place going?""His responce was that there are only so many $ available to him andthe lead time on an instrument like a COBE, Magellan, Hubble, etcis 5-10 years minumum.  If he spent all that could be spent on usingcurrent instruments in the current budget enviroment he would havevery little to nothing for future projects.  If he did that, surein the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular,however starting a few years after he had retired he would becomeone of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for notfunding the early stages of the next generation of instruments.  Justas he had benefited from his predicessor's funding choices, he owed itto whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing newmissions, even at the expense of cutting off some instruments beforethe last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them."

1996,"Then allow me to enlighten you, Rex. You see, there's a thing called a tie. A tie is worth one point (I know, I know. You're not good at math. But bearwith me). A win is worth two points.

Fromreading I thought that what they might actually do is:	new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25	This results in all the coordinates ending in either ""0.25"" or ""0.75"" whichever is closer.By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find thatneither of these is what DPS really uses.

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000and that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops,British Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  Thereare also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down hereit's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kidwithout a pair of skates.  And before you say ""what does he know? He's fromCalifornia."" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia,a town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radioplay by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, werethe last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I wason skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreationalhockey for about 35 years.Lack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play forthe Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for clubdues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club duescover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unlessthe city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the ""inner city""areas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in anindustrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin LutherKing, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown(I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just westof 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town.Dublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensiveto run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy icetime expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of themgive you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour andinclude the resurfacing time in the fee."

2055,"McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X        HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect SouthernCalifornia day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship lastSaturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technologydemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)rocket ship.        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White SandsMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start inmid-June.        Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast forSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of afollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required fora sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister governmentagencies.        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs fororbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recentchanges in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTOless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X asa step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,said Col.  Simon ""Pete"" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Wordendeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for theprogram. ""I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money Ihave available to spend,"" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnellDouglas Astronautics headquarters.        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbitalobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the ""better,faster, cheaper"" approach to hardware development.  The agency believesthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that ""leapfrog"" ahead ofevolutionary technology developments.        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a ""build a little, test alittle"" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He saidthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --showed how today's engineers could move beyond the ""miracles of ourparents' time.""        ""The key is management,"" Worden said. ""SDIO had a very light handon this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.""        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden saidlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will becrucial. ""It's essential we do not end up with a large managementstructure where the price goes up exponentially.""        SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of theHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. ""This is the directionwe're going to have to go,"" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee'sDemocratic chairman. ""Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren'tsustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.""        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further.Joking that ""a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,""Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if itwere left to the civil space agency.        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnellDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-stagedrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. ""Let's notbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!""         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said theprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with itsC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautiousabout a large private secotro commitment. ""On very large ventures,companies put in seed money,"" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas'senior vice president for space systems. ""You need strong governmentinvestments.""        While the government and industry continue to differ on fundingfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach todevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to DouglasAircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way forthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry couldeventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will ""expand the envelope""of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  Thefirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticletake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000feet.        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The finaltests will include a ""pitch-over"" manever that rotates the vehicle backinto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles ""Pete""Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehiclesaircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automatedcheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology willbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than thePratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquidhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds ofthrust        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 modelhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-onthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapidturnaround.        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employtri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff andthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes."

2064,"I think the three-headed GM's guiding principle was to keep veteransin favor of youngsters only if they offered a ""significant"" advantage.At the end of last season, the contracts of several veterans with somewhatmaginal contributions (Fenton, Bozek, Anderson, and a couple others Ican't remember) were bought out. The idea was that youngsters couldplay almost as well, and had the potential to improve where theseolder guys did not. And they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because hewasn't good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimisticin thinking they could make up for his contributions.An example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basisbut not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decentcontributor worth keeping around.The youth movement has its advantages; look at Gaudreau whomight still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around.

2074,"I've never seen a game where one player has committed 5penalties.  Something like this would require more attention bythe referee.But you're creating a scoring opportunity where there might nothave been one before.  I can see the relationship between freethrows awarded after a certain number of fouls, but it'sobviously easier to score in basketball, there are moreopportunities.  If a basketball team scores 100 points, that'sat least fifty chances made.  The average number of shots takenby each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) isprobably around 40, and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe5 of them.  You have some good ideas concerning the otherpenalties, but I think that a player should be awarded apenalty shot only when they had a chance to score and wasinterfered with.Also, later in the post, you talked about how boring the NBAgame you attended was, that play was stopped too often.Wouldn't your penalty shot rule take up more time during ahockey game?"

Certainly thiswas mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as beinglikely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were eitherconfused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up thechain inside SGI was misleading them.There were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 cameout at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  Thechassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  I'd say 4 years wasa pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day andage.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both thehardware and product design groups; we would have been out of ourminds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almostfrom the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker inthe form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions overits lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.Please, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI supportor sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folksto misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes therewill be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available,but that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what youare referring to).Yes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters,but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can resultin good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks intosystems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing*you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)They don't get all that long a lead time either; although certainlythey get presentations on possible new products, and their opinionsmay well influence the end product, but that also is life in theindustry.  We can't design systems that meet just their needs, or wewon't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that wedon't have some niche products, like Reality Engine).But surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five yearperiod to be constantly upgradable over that entire five yearperiod?

We grewup in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles,nuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these weremiracles of our parent's doing.  For a decade and more the punditshave told us - ""you've lost it!""  The ""me"" generation is onlyliving on the accomplishments of the past.     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  Welisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Livinghistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tellof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe asGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle- to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousanddollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken onlyof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.Schriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that thebest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman andPoseidon ballistic missiles.     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. This event is proof.  To our technological parents: We've listenedto your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. And we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Letme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetusbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatestengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Yourinsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporatedinto today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.     You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - asingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  Youadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as areall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  Youconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weldits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of aprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from thegeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinentalaviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a littleand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner whostarted this program for the SDI.     Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't evenstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested alittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before theymoved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or morebefore putting the first ""rubber on the road.""  Max Hunter - youdidn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going totake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusableaerospace transportation is real.     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  sameteam here today but a few years to show through the StrategicDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in abouta year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled ourcommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the SovietUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscoredthe importance of our work in bringing about a new internationalrelationship.     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place theframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for thenext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  Thissummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for thefirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next threeyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use spacerapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  Andyes - we'll make a little money off it too!     Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years tobuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 ofspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of therocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts tocounter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars!     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap tothe final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't SaturnV's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extradollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbitalsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed theway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocketexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape theworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks athand!"
2081,"Nice try Deepak, but ""tough Whaler squad"" should have clued you in to thefact that my Leaf woofing was tongue-in-cheek.If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety thenit is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive timesin 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things willbe carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that isonly for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing withinjuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would reallyrather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say thisfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and Idon't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typicallyhuman attitudes.  With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff""take"" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikelyto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you aregoing to come back with ""winning spirit"" and all of that crap but theseplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to makea decent living. Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is being paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does hisjob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Championsof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top after the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merelyaccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and ""hot"".  The emphasis on the playoffs, with their ""sudden death"" appeal has been promotedby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.

2082,"Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]      Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of theCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:  SPACE ADVERTISING    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is verycommon practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on thespace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the(very prominent) logos on its side of   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and   - the GPS/Navstar program office   This has not been considered ""paid advertising"" but rather""public relations"", since the restrictions have been such that onlyorganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on theside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, puttinga 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the camerasis ""advertising"" as much as it is ""public relations"", in myopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle hasrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentialsfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing largeadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know ofseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked atputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payloadbay.  These ventures would be different than ""public relations"", inthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firmsparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums forthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (Forexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting aDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameraswould scan past it.)  ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowedto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoecompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the lastOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items fromparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, forexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of theBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launchvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMETrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisementson the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie ""The LastAction Hero"".  Besides the usual logos of the participatingorganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on themain fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its boosterrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth forone month.  A concept for this advertising display was published inSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, istalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea hecreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertisingsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for thespace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space onthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it ""would not usehis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA andreceiving compensation.""   This is being disputed, since the launchis a ""commercial launch"" and NASA is receiving none of theadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program iscoming from NASA.)  ORBITAL ""BILLBOARDS""   Orbital ""billboards"" have been the staple of science fiction forsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and RobertHeinlein described another in ""The Man Who Sold the Moon"".  Severaldifferent potential projects have been developed, although none havebeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the ""EiffelII"" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture inorbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.

2084,"Gee, you'd think Winnipeg would be tops on that list, what with 8 regularsbeing European.Well, being a Jet fan, I sometimes wish that Bure would get knocked sillytoo.  (Nothing serious, just enough to keep him out of a game. :)In most cases, the owners have very little to do with it.  They give theirgeneral managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the bestplayers so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player isin Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes himto be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadianplayers.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The ownerscan do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcablehere in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the USthat the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push theirimport ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, wouldmake players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at thelower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are somethat play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farmclub, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or onthe secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russianplayers in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.))So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey playersin North America.I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in theworld.  I've grown up with Europeans playing on 'my' team, and some of thoseplayers were the among the best in the world.  From Hedberg, Nilsson, andSjoberg, to Sel{nne, Zhamnov, and Olausson, and all those in between and tocome, I wouldn't have it any other way."

2091,"   Other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such..   Why not??Because to be any use as a nav point you need to know -exactly- whereit is, which means you either nail it to something that doesn't moveor you watch it all the time.  Neither of which is possible on adeactivated spacecraft.  Then you have to know exactly how far awayfrom it you are; this may or may not be possible with the hardware onboard. Apart from which, there is absolutely no need for navigation beacons."

2096,"I can only comment on the Kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasantsurprise is Alex Zhitnik. He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, buthe's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish hewere more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade awaythat huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggestdisappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he'sonly a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, thoughnot through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, theaward goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily beMVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of theleague's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewergoals than Hartford.

2109,"Here is a press release from the White House. Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey TeamApril 19; Q&A Following To: National Desk Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100   WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcriptof remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine ""BlackBears"" NCAA Division I hockey champions:                           The Rose Garden 9:58 A.M. EDT     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It'san honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, thewinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to theRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchellthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to wina national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together towin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together tocheer them onto victory.     Coming from a state that is also relatively small insize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I canunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.In our state people are still talking about the time we won theOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that wasback in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Mainewill as proud of this team as they are today.     You know, in my state football is a slightly morepopular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, Ican understand a little more about hockey than I did before I camehere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It doeshave one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wishwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  Inthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the MajorityLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; juniorSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'mactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much youngerthan me.     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has donea great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championshipgame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else Iknow a little bit about.     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teamsand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell andSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Mainemust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as ateam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come frombehind.     I think it's important, as I ask young people fromaround America who have achieved outstanding things in workingtogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized andappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of valuesand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for allof our lives.     We now have another role model, and I'm glad to havethem here today.  (Applause.)     (The President is presented with team jersey.)(Applause.)     THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful.(Applause.)     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)                             * * * * * *     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Wacothis morning, sir?     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the AttorneyGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questionsto her and to the FBI.     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how itshould be executed?     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.That was their judgment, the FBI.     Q  Is this a raid?     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to bedone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tacticaldecisions.     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about thismorning?     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay myquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  SenatorMitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happenthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going tohave for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes totalk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, andtalk some more.     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that yourcompromise is no compromise.     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, SenatorDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted forthe same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our researchindicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reaganand Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of thosepurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American peopleback to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but youcan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this positionthey're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-yeardeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that timeand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all gotto be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base theirposition.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of thiskind that had very little to with putting the American people back towork.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful.We'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty goodabout it.     THE PRESS:  Thank you                                 END       10:10 A.M. EDT -30-"

2143,"  The commercial uses of a transportation system between already-settled-and-civilized areas are obvious.  Spaceflight is NOT in this position.The correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the longtransocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn't require gov't tofund these as long as something was known about the potential for profitat the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private.But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amountof money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.  I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop,and large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you askme for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, Ican't give them.  We just don't know enough.  The launch rate demanded byexisting space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, andwe are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industrieswill be, when they will practical, how much will have to be invested tostart them, etc."

Most of the Flames neglectedto show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at leastfive posts! The Flames best line was probablySkrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). GarySuter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scoredby D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also madesome bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especiallyimpressive. The games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early andnever recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches,hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out WarrenRychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failedto take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't thinkVernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men,as Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope Kinginserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday'sgame.

ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL bysqueezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesotagame) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseballtelecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off lastnight).But the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.

Displaying all 256 levelssynchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. Afterexperimenting with different aperture settings and screenbrightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectablecontrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were novisible contrast bands.To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixelsthat had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254,etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that wasvery fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating theseframes sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camerashutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrotedirectly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in thetop left corner of the screen instead of the center.

2169,"Printer model and specification:Canon CLC 500 (Color Laser Copier)ps-ipu unit (postscript intelligent processing unit)Hello,We have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copier/printer. We want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network.  The copier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured theprinter with the ""lp"" system using the parallel interface and can print postscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in turn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts are less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of programs, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript with tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 rather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that acceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image formatand translating the image into postscript.We suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality pictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the SCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a warranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without some assurance that the product will work.Here my questions:If anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or parallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?Is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is thelimiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on the printer?

2182,"Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarterof what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros onNHL teams have escalated to the following stats:Canadians: 400Americans: 100Europeans: 100   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.   Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sickof watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, theRed Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like ""Bure"" ""Konstantinov"" and""Borshevshky"". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on otherteams is getting worse as well.     I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about ""Pavel Bure, theRussian Rocket"" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I seethe Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not aCanucks fan to begin with ;-).     Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is thatI resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (andsome Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIRNORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't evenbetter hockey players. It's all hype. This ""European mystique"" is sickening,but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continueto have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearlyonly getting worse.

The conference was organised bythe European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre forthe Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).OLYMPUS has been particularly useful :-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few       examples.-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over       Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was theworld's largest telecommunications satellite; and no othersatellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining fourdifferent payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to someof the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite isgiven in order to test new telecommunications techniques orservices; over the past four years some 200 companies andorganisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learningorganisation.As the new technologies and services tested by theseOLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they thenmake use of operational satellites such as those ofEUTELSAT."

2191,"There are many teams in the NHL who have taken a liking to Russian players.The ""whole Russian strategy"" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano,who was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, mostnotably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years withPhilly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oatesfor Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantlyto the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered backproblems from which he never really recovered).Put Scotty Bowman, Pat Burns, or any of the other better coaches in the league behind the bench of this Detroit team, and they could beat anybody."

The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I can't remember his name)either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build theBradley Center.Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was toohigh.Like I said, I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but ifit's true, don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.  The Admiralsaren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL cluband a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBA'sMilwaukee Bucks play there as well."

2197,"We're probably stuck, as Mike Burger pointed out that the baseballdeal was made far in advance of the NHL contract.  WABC did the samething; they were thankful that the Devils were wiped out by 9:30,because they had to switch over to Yankees baseball.  The proof of the reasons for this is left to the reader ...It's too bad, but I wonder if ESPN is stuck with other US local teamcoverage for their alternate games?  We got NESN's coverage of theBruins-Sabres with the Boston homers ... they were awful!!!  I've readthat Derek Sanderson is the colour analyst ... I wonder if he spenthis early years after hockey as an intern at PRAVDA before landingthis job?  *Everything* had to be twisted into something good to sayabout the Bruin(s) involved ... not even Bill Wirtz's shills on SCChicago (Pat Foley, Dale Tallon) were this bad.  And just to be fair,SC used to take their feed from ESN (Empire Sports Network), the Sabrehomers and they were horrible too ... but they were spacy.From the CNN highlights, I hear Chris Cuthbert's voice from the CBCcoverage of the Habs-Nords series.  Too bad that we couldn't get iton ESPN, with all due respect to the Sabres and the Bruins.Mike Emrick is substituting on the Devils SCNY team for Gary Thorne.Mike was the original Devils TV play-by-play announcer, by the way.gld"

2203,"Our shop uses a package called CADCore - very good - to scan andsubsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps.

The long answer is yes - but afew have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unix's arethe same, you know! As far as ""many bugs"" go, it would probably be moreuseful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-)Platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: RS6000, Dec UltrixSun Solaris so it is possible.The main problem is that I don't have access to other platforms than theRS6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way I hearabout them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as tohow to fix it.As far as the software not doing anything, do you really think I wouldbother releasing it, if that was the case? Perhaps you didn't read thefew docs that ARE supplied. The dogfight world is made up of clientsonly, so if you're in there on your own, then you're not going to seeanything!

2221,"Everyone keeps talking about European expansion by 2010 thinkingwishful thoughts, but being totally off the ball.The league format we use here is incompatible with that in Europe.(for those that don't know, the best teams from lower divisions getpromoted and the worst get demoted).Would European fans put up with our ""if you've paid, you can play"" attitude??How long would they support teams that are run on Ranger-based corporate thinking (I use the term lightly).  (We don't need a goodproduct because these duffuses in NYC would fill the arena for Ottawa'srecord every year......1940!! haha (sorry, had ta say it)).If hockey (and other pro sports) had a similar system to Europe, maybeteams like the Rangers would be forced to compete (or get demoted the fourth division).  We'd have many more teams...centres that aren't as big (likeHalifax or Adirondack....ok, so Halifax isn't a good example) would eventually get promoted, and every team would be somewhat competetive withinits own division (unlike Ottawa, SJ, Edmonton, etc.). Fans would eventuallyget rewarded for their loyalty (or penalized for their neglect), and theleague would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influxof newly promoted teams (and the Halifax Citadels win the Stanley Cup...I candream, can't I??)Look at British (or any European) soccer as an example (they never have fanproblems).Just someone who thinks our system really sucksBarfly(feel free to flame me, my account ends today...hahahaha)"

2227," Markus had a good season in MoDo in the Swedish elite league, scoring 22 goals, 17 assists, 39 points and 67 PIM in 39 games. As Daryl points out, Markus won't be joining the Pens for this year's playoffs, since the World Championships starts April 18th. But there is a good chance that Markus will join the Pens before next season. MoDo, though, naturally wants to keep their superstars Forsberg and Naslund, so the latest news on this is that MoDo is looking for personal sponsors for Forsberg and Naslund in order to match the kind of money they would receive in NHL. Actually, Swedish coach Curt Lundmark is thinking about leaving two spots open for additions from eliminated NHLers. It is Mats Sundin and Calle Johansson that Curt hopes can join the team, although in a late stage of the tournament.

2247,"The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period, butKevin Dineen's 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win,7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row. Alexander Mogilny led thecomeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shotson goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny andLaFontaine all night.Roster move:Andre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthyscratch.Lines:Eklund-Lindros-RecchiBeranek-Brind'Amour-DineenLomakin-Butsayev-ConroyFaust-Acton-BrownGalley-BowenYushkevich-HawgoodCarkner-McGillTommy SoderstromGame Summary:Say, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get thatwoman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS havebeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in thefirst period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sundaywhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them thathe was getting bored back there...Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. AfterBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boardsto Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it aheadto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passedthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him andin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with hisstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to theright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric andGarry should turn down their assists :-).The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strongand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensivestruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play whenTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk intothe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and nota terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny gota post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi togive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the leaguedidn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create agood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towardsthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody keptmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to givethe Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and thefans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shotswere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay wasdisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considereda rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way theseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it wasRuss Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and EdSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd doit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled fornext year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at theend of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.He expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division titlethe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This basedon the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.He's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it ""outstanding""). Happy withthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unfluxof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that therewas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen infour years if there was a consensus.The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad Maytook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little troublegetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was movingthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabresblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passedacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and thetop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck tricklingthrough the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won therace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.Then Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue lineand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom wasall over it.The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking whenBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefertook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln'tget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into theFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it andheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead tomake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the topof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, JohnMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.But the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time tojust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were allover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got throughSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone thatmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander ashe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.Mistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worriedabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line rightnext to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, andmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at thepuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing hisstick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaksend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.Lindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high stickingminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to getset up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continuedto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.Things evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGillallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before afaceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out ofhim. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, andthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so longthey could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed toLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down bySoderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side ofthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom hadmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were wavingat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty netat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying toput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasekwas strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into theneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERSblue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from theleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip betweenthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting offangles...That was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.Into the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get theFLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund inthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle untilhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, hehit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.Than an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgooduntouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck underSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,horn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strangereason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what theycould be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick bladethat went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteriafor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERScould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,but were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puckfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it acrossto Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the netjust inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,but twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncingpuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.But the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensiveleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skateout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flewin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at5:24 to tie the game at 4.Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set upin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone inthe middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through theline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard wentafter it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skatedto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashingthrough the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it overthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the seasonfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35thof the season.Then Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabrespower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of thechances on the FLYERS resulting power play.Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had tomake some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running out as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own leftcorner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and foundDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at theright of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Actonchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48on his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before thegame.So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested muchin his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so).The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 againstwith three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goalsdespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th placesince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.A couple misc notes:Forget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow toannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.The Times of Trenton has reported that ""a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma""has looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that nofurther tests are necessary in the near future.Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not heexpected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back,he feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept arole scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.FLYERS team record watch:Eric Lindros:41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points(rookie records)club record goals:			club record points:Eric Lindros	40 1992-93		Dave Poulin	76 1983-84Brian Propp	34 1979-80		Brian Propp	75 1979-80Ron Flockhart	33 1981-82		Eric Lindros	74 1992-93Dave Poulin	31 1983-84		Ron Flockhart	72 1981-82Bill Barber	30 1972-73		Pelle Eklund	66 1985-86Mark Recchi:52 goals, 69 assists, 121 points.club record goals:			club record points:Reggie Leach	61 1975-76		Mark Recchi	121 1992-93*Tim Kerr	58 1985-86,86-87	Bobby Clarke	119 1975-76Tim Kerr	54 1983-84,84-85	Bobby Clarke	116 1974-75Mark Recchi	52 1992-93		Bill Barber	112 1975-76Rick Macliesh	50 1972-73		Bobby Clarke	104 1972-73Bill Barber	50 1975-76		Rick Macliesh	100 1972-73Reggie Leach	50 1979-80*More than 80 games.FLYERS career years:Player		Points	Best Prior SeasonMark Recchi	121	113 (90-91 Penguins)Rod Brind'Amour	84	77 (91-92 FLYERS)Garry Galley	62	38 (84-85 Kings)Brent Fedyk	59	35 (90-91 Red Wings)That's all for now..."

2267,"I don't buy this at all. Roy was the reason the game was tied... and thatwould *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool. Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ...Both Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just becausehis gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from end-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall for most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very well, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over Bellows' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all those opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them.Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ... Sure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but againstan explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many witha powerplay that was totally unnecessary.I disagree. Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night. The defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic,Nolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities,as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeauwere *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gaveup the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. Roy is paid big money becausethat is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5,when you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of himfor most of the season.The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatorycomments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why shouldthey read the papers? They played 58 minutes of ""Burnsian"" hockey to shutdown Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the extra 2.Red Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That's a guaranteed way to end theseries 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ?The fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.If you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should neverhave been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of workby Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped thepuck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all."

2269,"Hi! Everyone,Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guessmy question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle whichrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipseand its offset is same everywhere.This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs thepositions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse stillan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American IndutrialStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which wasimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also soldinternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And mostimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last yearto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of thisproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entireor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse froma quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is notanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make thingscomplicated. Please give me a hint.I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.However, so many people involved in the problem ""sphere from 4 poits"".Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?Please post here and let the others share our interests (I got several emails from our netters, they said they need thesummary of the answers)."

2271,"Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use somehelp with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input inaddition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 graylevel images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how toformat the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initialproblems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from aparallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the videosignal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However theydid say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, butthey didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and theywould call Japan, etc.Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel imagesfrom the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's notlike memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information ongetting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I wouldgreatly appreciate your sending it to me.Thanks."

This is simply an ad hominumattack and you know it.Of course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen anyorganization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimatecosts, such as libraries and other things that must be there to supporta program and ""wrap"" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrapwas on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down yousay is not true. Which is it Allen?As you have posted on this subject Allen, you state that wrap is over andabove overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong.Nasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get somenumbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and thenhowl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.Integration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy ofReston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who arecompletely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. Thereis no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale projectthat it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for Apollo?Oh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big.They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused itreplaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep yourbias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out justhow wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly whatthey want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it. I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successfullarge scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating thatintegration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is calledleadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility forthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadershipand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set upas Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFCand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston tofinally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of theprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is thatfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of theturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It islack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack ofleadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only asymptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in yourefforts that you do not see this.No, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have happened in the first place.I have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that isat reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totallyignoring the lack of leadership of congress. This many headed hydra thathas grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative ofyour position."

He couldn't hit abull in the ass with a banjo!! Al must remember a few years back when Mick scored 3 goals in one period against the Caps in a 5-3 Isles win. I was thereand was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. Wake-up Al!!! Years later he'sgotten worse. He's a cheap shot artist and always ends up gettingstupid/senseless penalties. I think he would make a good police officier!!!As for Pilon, he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. He eithermakes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. He can'tstay on his skates with most forwards or centers. He either falls down or committs a penalty. Call up somebody from Capital District AL!!!!!As far as the playoffs, the Isles are as difficult to figure out as the Caps.Two good teams with talent but so inconsistent. They should meet in the firstround. The Isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so theyshould play well against Jersey tonite. It'll probably be another tight 1-goalgame as the last 20 games hve been for the Isles. I wish when the get a leadthey could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensiveshell and letting the opposition get back in the game. Al MUST understand hecan't do with this team what he did with the 80-83 Isles. maybe Al should gotto. Where is Bobby Nystrom?? Clark Gilles?? John Tonelli?? These are the kindof young minds we need behing the bench!!    FIRE AL!!!!John ScialdoneSCIALDONE@NSSDCA.GSFC.NASA.GOV"

2348,"Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  Forexample, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a ""safe""mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and ifmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economygets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments""turned off"" rather than just ""safed"".  Was it political (i.e.as along as they could be used, someone would keep buggingcongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them peskyscientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....  I've heard the argument that an active but ""uncontrolled""spacecraft causes ""radio noise.""  I find that hard to believethat this could be a problem in a properly designed ""safe"" mode.This safe mode could be a program routine which causes thespacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission cancontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back tothe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when thespacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could beprepared if necessary.  As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact isbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal.By making the time and signal location generally known, perhapssomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept thedata even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft whichcould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going toplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,exiting the solar system, etc).   Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,etc) should consider designing in a ""pause"" mode in case theirspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion ofthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo couldhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission""drift"" phase.So any holes in all this?"
