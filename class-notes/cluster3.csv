38,"Ethnocentric USian that I am, I've assumed that we and thexUSSR were the only countries with significant capabilities to tracknon-cooperative objects in low Earth orbit. Grazing in a couple of databases recently,  I found that Japan has some optical capabilitiesalong this line, and also uses a radar designed for other purposesfor orbital debris surveys (it isn't clear whether the radar can determine orbital elements for the objects it detects). Abstracts of the articles are appended.     This leads to the more general question: do yet other people than the US, Russia, and Japan do space surveillance, and if so, how and why?

In Japanese, with abstract in English.     This paper reports the optical tracking results of EGS(experimental geodetic satellite) which was launched on August 13,1986, by NASDA. The EGS optical tracking experiment process and anoutline of the Radio Research Laboratory (RRL) optical ground       <----station are discussed. A star tracking technique for opticalequipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbitprediction improvement are also described. The accuracy of EGStracking data obtained by RRL at the request of NASDA is alsodiscussed. In addition, it is briefly demonstrated that theposition of the Japanese amateur satellite (JAS-1) which waslaunched with the EGS, was accurately determined by means of a      <----satellite tracking video. It is clear from this experiment that     <----optical observation data (i.e., satellite direction data) are very  <----useful for satellite orbit determination during initial launch      <----stages. Furthermore, the results confirm the effectivenes of these  <----two satellite optical tracking techniques.                          <----MU radar measurements of orbital debrisSATO, TORU; KAYAMA, HIDETOSHI; FURUSAWA, AKIRA; KIMURA, IWANE(Kyoto University, Japan)AIAA, NASA, and DOD, Orbital Debris Conference: Technical Issues and Future Directions, Baltimore, MD, Apr. 16-19, 1990. 10 p. RPN: AIAA PAPER 90-1343     Distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross section are determined from a series of observations made with a high-power VHF Doppler radar (MU radar) of Japan. An automated data processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail echoes or lightning atmospherics. Although the results are preliminary, they showed good agreement with those from NORAD tracking radar      <----observations using a much higher frequency. It is found that the     <----collision frequency of a Space Station of 1 km x 1 km size at an altitude of 500 km with orbiting debris is expected to be as high as once per two years. Monitoring of the MU radar antenna pattern by Satellite Ohzora (EXOS-C)SATO, T.; INOOKA, Y.; FUKAO, S. (Kyoto Univ., Japan); KATO, S.Kyoto Univ., Uji (Japan). Radio Atmospheric Science Center.In International Council of Scientific Unions, Middle Atmosphere Program.Handbook for MAP, Vol. 20 5 pPublication Date: Jun. 1986      As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere troposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar features an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large VHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed to individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier feeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the antenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal division/combination are performed at a low signal level using electronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the zenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna element was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to make a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific satellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna Monitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 watts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement and results are discussed."

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for theExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was receivedproperly.2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) testand a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test wereperformed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meterantenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysisis in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailedinformation relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degreesto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalancemeasurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DCmeasurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) andcurrently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent withthe model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.6.

181," It's the ""opening-game effect"" maybe. Pros arrive late, nervousness for rookie WC players, and problems to get the lines clicking may make things hard to get it going against these ""worse"" nations. I'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game, the better it is, since the chances of an upset are greater then. Some other reasons why the ""worse"" teams are so tough to beat was presented by Hans ""Virus"" Lindberg (former coach in Switzerland). 1) The ""worse"" teams (referring to France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy etc)    have now usually world class goalies. 2) Their defensive play have become much more disciplined, they take much    less unnecessary penalties. 3) They use four lines which makes it harder to make them ""run out of gas."" 4) The ice quality in the German WC rinks is poor. Another weird thing was that the Czechs played entertaining hockey.. err.. just kidding, David. Alex? That's a new name for me ;) OK, I forgot the Czech roster at home yesterday, but now I have it. I don't know the teams for all players, so I would appreciate if you guys could fill in the blanks for me (especially I think some of these players play in Finland).

261,"********************[ PC Game For Sale ]******************Waxworks by Horrorsoft/Accolade (5.25"")		   $30By the same folks who brought you Elvira I & II.  I playedElvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally madea very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel isroughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real timefighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games,especially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough tostay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This is not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it isquite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be foundthat is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fightingstrategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is no fighting at all (well almost none), though all four containmoderately challanging puzzles.The really interesting thing about this game is that it is really broken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibitsyou must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transportedwith no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits trapsyou inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must escape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibittraps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vinesand pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plantzombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescuesome humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to killthe very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This isperhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you intoJack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Rippervictim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You mustavoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and meet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibitpus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to stop the almost indestructible zombies.  Over all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a creepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, thoughgameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.I heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.   *********************************************************- All prices include shipping.- All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated.- US buyers only please.- All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,  priority USPS.- All games include all original materials including box, manual,  disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.The first responder offering asking price is guarenteed toget the game.

302,"Forwarded from John Spencer (spencer@lowell.edu):There will be two eclipses of Iapetus by Saturn and itsrings, in May and July.  Please spread the word!  Here's someinformation about the events, and then a couple of messages from JayGoguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse tolearn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also havesome money available...John Spencer, 1993/04/21Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturnitself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21,(21:16-09:38 UT).

Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen fromIapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new aboutthe rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomyand Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odellof Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to myattention.THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?  To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,  etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,  except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3  airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something  to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.  Jayand again:  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.jay"

The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airportreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and tookmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate datawith the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).       The data from the balloon flight will also be compared toreadings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttleDiscovery.     ""We launch these balloons several times a year as part of anongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is activelyinvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in threeimportant ways,"" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator onthe balloon research campaign.       ""There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,"" hecontinued.  ""The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truthfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its ownright.""     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add morepieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically themid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helpsscientists construct more accurate computer models which areinstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPLinstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measuresozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwaveradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fouriertransform infrared interferometer which monitors how theatmosphere absorbs sunlight.      Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to groundstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commandedto separate from the balloon.     ""We needed to fly through sunset to make the infraredmeasurements,"" Margitan explained, ""and we also needed to fly indarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.""     It will be several weeks before scientists will have thecompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forwardtheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard SpaceFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARSscientists.         The balloon was launched by the National Scientific BalloonFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under acontract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon waslaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind directionand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less thanone-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubicmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated withhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weighbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  Thescientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) poundsand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's UpperAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative MeasurementsProgram.                        "

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquirecelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinkedto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activityfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio RelayAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command losstimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for theExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was receivedproperly.5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verifythe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experimentdata; long term trend analysis is continuing.6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine theoptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminaryanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulationindex is near the optimal level.7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for theExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thrusterflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushedduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significantchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  Thesemeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC specialanomaly team.10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within           acceptable range       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within           acceptable range       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours           Time To Initiation - 260 hoursGDS (Ground Data Systems):1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance testfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verifythe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacementfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetryrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC TelemetrySubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA wasnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTSdata from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) ofthe TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.TRAJECTORY     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectorystatus was as follows:	Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)	Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)	Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour	Distance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km	Round Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 secondsSPECIAL TOPIC"

425,"Sorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...I'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps Ican help a little.Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effectsfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computergraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Eachframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render onhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphicswould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 framesper second).It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visualdatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  Thisis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilottraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping ofthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motionof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics systemmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complexdata representations.Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhapsdue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what wasvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (thegraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constantframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in generaldoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified theUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-timeoperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-timeoperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, noteven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only ourmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation dueto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environmentsrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-timemulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systemson the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularlyimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is anunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to developVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level. There areoff-the- shelf software packages available to get you going much faster,being targeted directly at the VR application developer.

The Itar-TASS news agency announced the launch of Cosmos 2238 from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, but provided little description of the payload's mission.

Image Format Compatibility	Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily openand save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or realdata values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formatsas well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.		    Image Analysis & Processing	For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes anassortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution product or principal component analyses.An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allowsthe user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively.Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trigonometric and transcendental functions.		    Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis	Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivityfor various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.).The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric andsurface conditions and instrument spectral bands.A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation,and 3-D image projection.		    Easy External Program Interfacing	Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externallydeveloped software algorithms for processing and converting satelliteobservations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parametersto external programs using special interface functions.		    Quick Quality Presentation	Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolutionmultispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 imageplanes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images,graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports.Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifyingand integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scaleoutput for standard inkjet and laser printers.	Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?

605,"	Ah, so now we're into European player bashing?  What next?  No more French Canadiens?  Yeah, there's an idea!  Let them French-speaking Canadiens have their own hockey league!  We don't want them!	Are you _CRAZY_?  The NHL is one of the true internationalleagues, and yes, there _ARE_ many Europeans who deserve to play inthe NHL and are better than some North Americans, look at Teemu!!!I, for one, am glad to see Europeans in the NHL and I hope theNHL soon expands to Europe.  Its nice to see all these differentpeople come together to form the (soon to be) 26 hockey teams.

627,"I was thinking about who on each of the teams were the MVPs, biggestsurprises, and biggest disappointments this year. Now, these are justmy observations and are admittedly lacking because I have not had anopportunity to see all the teams the same amount. Anyway....  MVP = most valuable player to his team both in terms of points and      in terms of leadership (""can't win without him"")  Biggest surprise = the player who rose above expectation -- the player      that may have raised the level of his game to a new height, even      if that new level doesn't necessarily warrant an allstar berth      (includes those players who at the outset of the season, may not      even have been in the team's plans).   Biggest disappointment = the player from whom we expected more (e.g., I      picked Denis Savard in Montreal because with the new emphasis on      offence brought by Demers, shouldn't Savard have done better?)   -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Team           Biggest       BiggestTeam:                   MVP:          Surprise:    Disappointment:-----------------------------------------------------------------------Boston Bruins           Oates          D.Sweeney     WesleyBuffalo Sabres          Lafontaine     Mogilny       Audette (jinx?)Calgary Flames          Roberts        Reichel       PetitChicago Blackhawks      Roenick        Ruuttu        GouletDetroit Red Wings       Yzerman        Chaisson      KozlovEdmonton Oilers         Manson         Buchberger    MellanbyHartford Whalers        Sanderson      Cassells      CorriveauLos Angeles Kings       Robitaille     Donnelly      HrudeyMinnesota North Stars   Modano      Tinordi(not expected back)  BrotenMontreal Canadiens      Muller         Lebeau        SavardNew Jersey Devils       Stevens        Semak         MacLeanNew York Islanders      Turgeon        King(finally) MaroisNew York Rangers        Messier        Kovalev       BourqueOttawa Senators         MacIver        Baker         JelinekPhiladelphia Flyers     Lindros/Recchi Fedyk/Galley  EklundPittsburgh Penguins     Lemieux        Tocchet(even for him)  JagrQuebec Nordiques        Sakic/Ricci    Kovalenko     PearsonSan Jose Sharks         Kisio          Gaudreau      MaleySt Louis Blues          Shanahan       C.Joseph      Ron SutterTampa Bay Lightening    Bradley        Bradley       Creighton/KasperToronto Maple Leafs     Gilmour        Potvin        Ellett/AndersonVancouver Canucks       Bure           Nedved(finally)    MomessoWashington Capitals     Hatcher        Bondra/Cote   ElynuikWinnipeg Jets           Selanne        Selanne       Druce----------------------------------------------------------------------  As I mentioned up top, these are my *impressions* from where I sit.

The printer prints at a maximum of 300*300        (D)ots (P)er (I)nch (D.P.I.) on many different types        and sizes of paper, including envelopes and        transperencies.  Printer prints in both landscape and        portrait modes.  Printer can accept up to two        cartridges giving it things like more memory or        additional fonts.  Printer works excellently with        Windows and DOS and brings TrueType to its full        potential.         I originally purchased the printer for $375.00.  Make me        an offer, but I would prefer to stay in the $300.00        range.  I will pay the shipping to anywhere in the         continental U.S.A.

The    publication was enormously successful: we distributed 2000 copies to    space enthusiasts across the country and even sent a few to people in    Great Britain, Australia, and Ecuador. Due to the tremendous response to    the first edition, PPS has published an expanded, up-to-date second    edition of the guide.    The 40-page publication boasts 69 listings for summer and full-time job    opportunities as well as graduate school programs. The second edition of    ""Space Jobs"" features strategies for entering the space field and    describes positions at consulting and engineering firms, NASA, and    non-profit organizations. The expanded special section on graduate    schools highlights a myriad of programs ranging from space manufacturing    to space policy. Additional sections include tips on becoming an    astronaut and listings of NASA Space Grant Fellowships and Consortia, as    well as NASA Centers for the Commercial Development of Space.

Bussard, Journal of	Propulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990	    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion	    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the	    thrust-power ""gain"" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values	    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are	    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, ""high-thrust""	    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system	    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local	    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100	    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer	    ""high-thrust"" flight capability. One performance example shows a	    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with	    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows	    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in	    Earth/moon space.

Center	Street, Manassas, VA 22110.	    [This is an introduction to the application of Bussard's version	    of the Farnsworth/Hirsch electrostatic confinement fusion	    technology to propulsion. 1500<Isp<5000 sec. Farnsworth/Hirsch	    demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in	    1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising	    stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for the	    panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim	    Bowery]	""PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications"", by	Paul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion	Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.	    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron	    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times	    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma	    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds	    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities	    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and	    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm	    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure	    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically	    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power	    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens	    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the	    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages	    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I	    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob	    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently	    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one	    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather	    than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the	    PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid	    MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]    ION DRIVES:	Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE	archive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the	SERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in	the 1960s and 70s.

It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION, DITHERING ....)  on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different  formts.  Include simple file management system.  Support 'slide show'.  There is NO LIMIT on image size.  Currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.  If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor, you must have VESA driver.  If you want to modify video driver, please read section (8).(2) Hardware Requirement:  PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher.  min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work).  (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance).  Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).  The following description is borrowed from DJGPP.

Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).   1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this      menu you can press any function key except F5. If you move or copy      files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like      'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.+       The header line in 'read' menu includes ""(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)"".+         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use        for reading current file.      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This        program will automatically determine which format this file is.        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check        standard extension. Still fail, report error.      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key          (except ESCAPE).        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.        ESCAPE to terminate.      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.      pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.      Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.      pressing RETURN: show image.        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text        mode.      pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do        special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.      pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.      pressing SPACE: save current image to file.        B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).        Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).        Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).        True Color: save as 24-bit image.        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image        to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change        directory to what you want. Then,        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename                      (filename under bar).  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,     the performance is poor.  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster       (No one is better for true 24bits image)  6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.  7. Not all subroutines are fully tested  8. This document is not well written.

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news    frequently.    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).    The ""Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,"" ASC G&C 2102,	""During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is	commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower	clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)	orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a	negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other	advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort	maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of	the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining	downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target	in second stage.""    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try    to interpret.    1)	We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.    2)	Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack	between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the	""relative wind"") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line	between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly	negative angle (""a negative q-alpha"").	This causes a little bit of	""downward"" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z	direction) and this force ""alleviates structural loading.""	We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the	most ""delicate"" part of the vehicle.    3)	The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more	mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or	to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be	the case if we didn't roll (""performance gain"").    4)	The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated	flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort	maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (""decreased abort maneuver	complexity"").    5)	The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio	antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio	antennae on the Orbiter (""improved S-band look angles"").    6)	The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a	helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.    7)	The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is	more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east	(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity	in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:	velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.	The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its	velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.    This all begs the question, ""Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to    achieve that attitude?""  The answer is that the pads were leftovers    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the ""top""    [Orbiter side] and the ""bottom"" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle    guy.)    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.	He added that the ""roll    maneuver"" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total    maneuver is really expressed as a ""quaternion,"" a grad-level-math    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element    array.    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite    for these viewers.    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions    are not being covered.

It is updated each month and only information currently under discussion or of continuing importance or interest will be listed for more than two postings.  Boston Bruins  Boston legislators and the developers proposing a new Boston Garden finally agreed to a deal that puts the 19,000-seat, $160 million project back on track to be finished in September 1995.  Right wing Daniel Marois will be sidelined indefinitely following surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back.**  Sent defenseman Glen Murray to Providence of the American Hockey League. Buffalo Sabres1-800-333-PUCK (1-800-333-7825)  Acquired left winger Bob Errey from Pittsburgh for defenseman Mike Ramsey.**  Veteran Buffalo Sabres broadcaster Ted Darling will be inducted into the club's Hall of Fame Sunday, April 11.  Darling, who joined the expansion Sabres in 1970, was the team's play-by-play announcer on both television and radio until illness forced him out of the booth during last season.**  Recalled forwards Viktor Gordiouk and Doug MacDonald from Rochester of American Hockey League. Calgary Flames  Acquired veteran right wing Greg Paslawski from Philadelphia for future considerations.**  Recalled center Todd Harkins and left winger Tomas Forslund from Salt Lake City of International Hockey League. Chicago Blackhawks        The $175 million, privately financed United Center, scheduled to open in August 1994, will be home to the NBA's Chicago Bulls and NHL's Chicago Blackhawks. The stadium is owned by entities controlled by the two teams. The owners apparently still have not made a decision on whether the old Chicago Stadium will be razed for parking space once the new facility, located directly across the street, opens.  Suspended defenseman Craig Muni indefinitely for failing to report following a trade with Edmonton. Detroit Red Wings  Acquired defenseman Steve Konroyd from Hartford for a sixth-round draft pick.  Annnounced the signing of right wing Joe Frederick, their 13th pick in the 1989 National Hockey League entry draft.**  Two contrite hockey fans have returned the stolen Michigan Sports Hall of Fame plaque honoring Detroit Red Wing great Gordie Howe. The bronze plaque was stolen more than four years ago from Cobo Hall in Detroit, site of the Michigan Hall of Fame. Edmonton Oilers  Sent forward Esa Tikkanen to the New York Rangers for center Doug Weight.  Traded defenseman Craig Muni to Chicago for forward Mike Hudson.  NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Edmonton Oilers' lease with Northlands Coliseum must be improved if the team is to survive in the city. Edmonton Northlands is a non-profit agency set up by the city to administer exhibition facilities including the Coliseum.  Oilers owner Peter Pocklington calls his lease with Northlands horrendous and has threatened to move the team if he doesn't get a better deal. He makes no money from parking, concessions or building advertising. The 17,313-seat Coliseum also has few of the lucrative private boxes that produce significant revenues for other owners.  Announced center Kevin Todd will not need surgery but will miss the remainder of the season with a separated shoulder. Hartford Whalers  Sent defenseman Steve Konroyd to Detroit for a sixth-round draft pick.  Acquired left winger Robert Kron and a third-round draft pick from Vancouver for left winger Murray Craven and a fifth-round draft pick.**  The state of Connecticut will begin negotiations to buy the Civic Center from the city in an effort to keep the financially struggling Hartford Whalers franchise in the city. Los Angeles Kings  Sent center John McIntyre to the New York Rangers for defenseman Mark Hardy and Ottawa's fifth-round 1993 draft pick. Minnesota North Stars1-800-800-0435 if calling from the U.S.1-800-800-0458 if calling from Canada  The Dallas City Council has approved an agreement with the Minnesota North Stars that will bring the NHL club to Reunion Arena next season.  Defenseman Mark Tinordi, captain of the North Stars, will be sidelined the rest of the season, including any postseason games the North Stars might play, because of a broken collarbone.  Acquired defenseman Mark Osiecki from Winnipeg for ninth- and 10th-round draft picks in 1993.  Added defenseman Travis Richards from the University of Minnesota.  A former employee filed a sexual harassment suit against Minnesota North Star owner Norman Green. Karen (Kari) Dziedzic, Green's former executive assistant, claims Green often instructed her to wear cosmetics, described her outfits as ""very hot"" and ""very sexy,"" once slapped her hand as she was about to eat and humiliated her by grabbing her hand and rubbing it through a client's hair.  The Minnesota North Stars, who will move to Dallas after this season, announced that nearly 11,000 season ticket reservations have been made for their new home at Reunion Arena, which has a capacity of 16,800.

Sent defenseman Rob Ramage to the Montreal Canadiens for minor league defensemen Eric Charron and Alain Cote and future considerations.**  Manon Rheaume's first starting appearance in goal for the Atlanta Knights was impressive enough for her coach to say she has a chance to be a backup goalie for another minor league team next season. Rheaume, the first female to play professional hockey, stopped 25 shots and gave up six goals against the Cincinnati Cyclones on Saturday night, April 10. After the game, her coach, Gene Ubriaco, said Rheaume performed well enough to compete for the No. 2 goalie spot with the Louisville IceHawks of the East Coast Hockey League next season. The Knights and the IceHawks are minor league clubs of the Tampa Bay Lightning.**  As their first season comes to a close, there are rumors swirling that the Tampa Bay Lightning just might become the Atlanta Lightning.  Or the Minnesota Lightning.  But they are just rumors, according to Lightning general manager Phil Esposito.  ESPN reported on Sunday, April 11, that the Lightning, who have been playing in 10,400-seat Expo Hall, are exploring opportunities to move to either Atlanta or Minneapolis.  But Esposito said there was no truth to the report.  ""We were disappointed with ESPN's irresponsible comment,"" Esposito said.  ""There is just no substance to the rumor."" Rumors have been swirling for the past two years regarding a move by Tampa Bay, which is presently discussing plans to build a new arena.

Playoffs: The system will be conference-based, with the No. 1 team meeting the No. 8 team in the first round, No. 2 vs. No. 7, No. 3 vs. No. 6 and No. 4 vs. No. 5. Matchups will be based on overall points with the four division champions being placed in the first- or second-place seeds in each conference and being assured of home-ice in the first two playoff rounds. All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except matchups between Central and Pacific teams.  Those series will rotate 2-3-2 to reduce travel.  In those cases, the team with the most regular-season points will choose whether to start the series at home or away.------ Draft news:        Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in June, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one goaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction between forwards and defensemen.        First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down from the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.        Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.        At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises will have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total of 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two new teams.        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst records. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry Draft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in 1994.        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the 1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.----- - League news:Disputes:  The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary arbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

Each team is owned by the league, with local interests controlling day to day operations. Each team has a $100,000 salary cap for 17 total players (16 dress up). Unlike the ECHL, players are not limited to three years in the league.  A Western Division may be added to the Central Hockey League for the 93-94 season if the plans of CHL president Ray Miron materialize.  Miron confirmed that El Paso, Amarillo, Tuscon, and Albuquerque are cities under consideration for the Western Division, which would play some interlocking games with the Eastern Division.  Meanwhile, San Antonio and Houston are close to being confirmed as the league's newest members.----- - Major League Hockey         A new hockey league with franchises throughout the United States and Canada will begin play in the fallof 1993, officials announced Wednesday, February 10.        Major League Hockey was founded by Roy Boe, former president of the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League and the New York/New Jersey Nets of the American and National Basketball associations.        According to Boe, the league will debut with six to eight teams playing a schedule of approximately 80 games. Franchise applications have been received from groups in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, San Francisco, Saskatoon, Toronto and Worcester, Mass., Boe said.        Although the league will not raid existing leagues to stock its rosters, Boe said it will seek the ``world's finest hockey players.''        Boe said league play will have an international flair and discussed implementing some rules which are reminiscent of those of the IIHF.        ``We're removing the red line, moving the goal nets forward and eliminating all tie games,'' said Boe.        The MLH office will operate out of Stamford, Conn.----- - British Premier Division:  contacts:  Neil A.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:  Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs? A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in and around Montreal. Hence they were called ""Les Habitants"" (natives of Montreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.  Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it? A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to signify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey. Q: What is the most informative hockey publication? A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is a weekly journal with up-to-date info.Phone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)Phone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)  Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in the NHL? A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 chances.  Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL? A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when a goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a +, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-handed goals do count for +/-.  Q: What is the five-hole? A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones: (1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower right, and (5) five-hole.  Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice? A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven series were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a game, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice. Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game? A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever to play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis Blues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat Expo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine shots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately lost the game, 6-4. Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history? A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed the richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be worth about $42 million.

996,"     TRIAD, the first drag-free satellite, was designed and built by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972.  The satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.     TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The 2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).     Further info on TRIAD, DISCOS, etc. can be found in ""Spacecraft Design Innovations in the APL Space Department,"" Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest, Vol. 13, No. 1 (1992)."

1001,"Archive-name: space/new_probesLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:17 $UPCOMING PLANETARY PROBES - MISSIONS AND SCHEDULES    Information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below    would be welcome. Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas    scintillation proportional counters.    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true    nature of Saturn's rings.

Has made    multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite,    into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to    orbit a satellite around the Moon.    MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire    surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity    map.    MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.    Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in    transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for    one martian year (687 days).    TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched    8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the    TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from    that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft    that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!    While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical    detail, see the many articles in the same issue.    OTHER SPACE SCIENCE MISSIONS (note: this is based on a posting by Ron    Baalke in 11/89, with ISAS/NASDA information contributed by Yoshiro    Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp). I'm attempting to track changes based    on updated shuttle manifests; corrections and updates are welcome.    1993 Missions	o ALEXIS [spring, Pegasus]	    ALEXIS (Array of Low-Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors) is to perform	    a wide-field sky survey in the ""soft"" (low-energy) X-ray	    spectrum. It will scan the entire sky every six months to search	    for variations in soft-X-ray emission from sources such as white	    dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars and flare stars. It will also	    search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron	    stars and gamma-ray bursters. ALEXIS is a project of Los Alamos	    National Laboratory and is primarily a technology development	    mission that uses astrophysical sources to demonstrate the	    technology.

A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the    remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as    providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on    the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP    directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via    email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com    or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions    on how to make requests.    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.    Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is    huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.VIEWING IMAGES    The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly    large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here.

To access the archives by email, send a letter to    archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the    subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:	send SPACE Index	send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.    The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in    caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use    one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this    section for images or programs.    The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image    disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The    disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are    available in these collections.    The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory    contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in    the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is    found in the IMDISP directory (see the item ""VIEWING IMAGES"" below).

Andromeda Software, Inc.	P.O. Box 605	Amherst, NY 14226-0605    COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS    Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula, based on    studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests.		     (1/3.4)    D = S  S  c  K  W	    : crater diameter in km	 g  p  f  n	       (1/6)    S = (g /g )		    : gravity correction factor for bodies other than     g	  e  t		      Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g	is the surface					    e		      t			      gravity of the target body. This scaling is			      cited for lunar craters and may hold true for			      other bodies.		(1/3.4)    S = (p / p )	    : correction factor for target density p  ,     p	  a   t							    t			      p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U			       a			      crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average			      rock on the continental shields.    C			    : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km			      in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).							    (1/3.4)    K			    : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent)     n			      empirically determined from the Jangle U			      nuclear test crater.	      3		   2		       19    W = pi * d	* delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  )			    : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent			      given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile			      density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3			      g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.    An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing    asteroids.    Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor    Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in    diameter.    More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):    Asteroid	    Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy    diameter (km)		       (impacts/year)	   (* 5*10^20 ergs)     10			    10		     10^-8		10^9      1			 1 000		     10^-6		10^6      0.1	       100 000		     10^-4		10^3    assuming simple scaling laws. Note that 5*10^20 ergs = 13 000 tons TNT    equivalent, or the energy released by the Hiroshima A-bomb.    References:    Gehrels, T. 1985 Asteroids and comets. _Physics Today_ 38, 32-41.

The latter was written with    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind    (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John    Snyder's USGS publication ""Map Projections--A Working Manual"", USGS    Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a    neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,    ""An Album of Map Projections"", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are    in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.    You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National    Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and    tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.    A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos,    (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call    them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a    check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up    for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.    A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:	R. Miller and F. Reddy, ""Mapping the World in Pascal"",	Byte V12 #14, December 1987	Contains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections. A	demo program, CARTOG.PAS, and a small (6,000 point) coastline data	is available on CompuServe, GEnie, and many BBSs.    Some references for spherical trignometry are:	_Spherical Astronomy_, W.M.

Convert parallax into distance using the    formula in part 6 of the FAQ, convert RA and declination to coordinates    on a unit sphere (see some of the references on planetary positions and    spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this), and    scale this by the distance.    Two databases useful for this purpose are the Yale Bright Star catalog    (sources listed in FAQ section 3) or ""The Catalogue of Stars within 25    parsecs of the Sun"" (in pub/SPACE/FAQ/stars.data and stars.doc on    ames.arc.nasa.gov)."

1110,"#I use xwd/xpr (from the X11R5 dist.) and various programs of the#ppm-tools to print hardcopies of colored X windows. My problem is,I don't like xpr. It gives (at least, the X11R4 version does) louzyoutput: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me.Instead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, andlets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel)image to black and white dots.So: if you have a PostScript printer, try:	xwdtopnm <xwdfile> |	# convert to PPM	[ppmtopgm |]		# .. to graylevel for smaller file to print	pnmtops -noturn |	# .. to PostScript	lpr			# printpnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care:If you want your image to be 4"" wide, use:	pnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4-noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it	is high)-width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below)-scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a	width less than 4"", and will thus be printed smaller than 4"" wide.	If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4"", and	will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified	paper width. 	In short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size,	but it will not blow it up automatically.Hope this helps.Marcel."

Can do simple display,  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions  [PC and Macs]LabVIEW 2---------  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the  ""program"" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual  instrument.  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has  utility functions for memory management data communications and  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for  the development of custom code.)Ultimage Concept VI-------------------  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and  characterization.  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can  be imported.  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom  modules.  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even  hole filling.  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494  707-579-1733IPLab Spectrum--------------  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a  movie command for cycling through windows.Macintosh-based tools=====================NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more---------------------------------  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been  developed by Spyglass.

It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table.

Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112Adobe Photoshop---------------  The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey  scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..

Several steps are often required to  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a  variety of powerful selection tools including the ""auto selection tool""  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close  hues, color range and mask.ImageStudio: Don't know...

One such feature allows the user to  select part of an image simply by ""painting"" it. A new polyline  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide  selections.  A brush lets the operator ""paint"" with a selected portion  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.

MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109Image Analyst-------------  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in  radiographs.  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or  a disk-stored image.  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

Documentation (PostScript mostly)  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and  can do image arithmetic, etc.    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.     There is currently a project - ""AIPS++"" - underway to rewrite the  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and  Australia to name a few.

Feature Description  DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and  spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of  modules.  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and  ratioing.  Host Configuration Requirements  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific  applications programs.  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be  interactively driven through this control.  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be  added to further enhance referenced imagery.  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional  processing of remote sensed data.

Supports 24-bit display""HIPS----(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well  as a huge user-contributed library.  Feature description  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users  become effective using HIPS on their first day.  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual  pages, and on-line documentation.  Host Configuration Requirements  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.  Availability  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse.

However,	I have used it effectively in ""tape studio"" applications for mastering,	and it works great.  3.75 and 7.5 ips speeds, supports up to 7"" reels.	Dual lighted VU meters with record indicators.  Full auto-reverse	capable (and the mechanism works, too!).  Adjustable sound on sound,	and socket for remote control (I don't know where you'd find one, but	they used to make 'em), plus a 110VAC unswitched outlet.  This unit	is in excellent condition and I have had it rebuilt once since I got	it--works perfectly.	Price:  $225.00 or best offer, or possible trade (see below).	Panasonic KX-P1624 printer.  24-pin with 360x360dpi resolution in both	text and graphics modes.  Warranty cards, manuals, all the usual stuff	you expect when buying like-new merchandise.  I'm selling it because I	now have a better printer.  This is the wide carriage version of the	KX-P1124, by the way.  Test prints are available upon request.	Price:  $250.00 o.b.o. or trade.	Excalibur custom pool cue.  19 oz., 13 mm, brass joint, Irish linen	wrap, could use a new tip but will hold up for a while.  I've got too	many cues as it is, and don't need this one.  Hits nicely, is very	straight and in excellent condition.	Price:  $125.00 o.b.o. or trade.  Imperial hard case (1 butt/1 shaft)	available for an additional $40.00.TRADES:  I need the following things, and I have no cash of my own right now,so if you want to trade, it needs to be straight-across.   The list:	Amiga ROM upgrade to at LEAST 2.04, preferably 2.1+, with appropriate	DOS and Workbench.	1 meg Agnus chip for the Amiga.	Amiga hard drive and controller (preferably SCSI).	IBM-compatible hard drive (and controller if not MFM).  This one's 	touchy, as I have a full-height and don't have room for more unless	I swap out--needs to be above 100M, and I will consider trading a	good ST-4096 in the deal.	Intel 9600EX or 14.4EX or similar EXTERNAL high-speed modem."

In case of the Earth z is about 23.5 degrees, I think.I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus, z is almost90 degrees.u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured.Paris is at about 45 degrees.  North pole is at 90.a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from0 to 360 degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun.The spring equinox occurs at a=0.L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day).On the equator (u=0) L is always 1/2.  Near the north pole (u=90 degrees)L is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.Computation:Define the auxiliary angles p and q by:sin p = sin a sin zcos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       (0 < q < 180 degrees)Conclusion:L = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees)L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)Wait!  But what is h?The cutoff function h is defined as follows:h (s) = s    if  |s| < 1      = 1    if   s > 1      = -1   if   s < 1As an interesting exercise, plot L versus a.   The graph will showshow the length of the daylight varies with the time of the year.Experiment with various choices of latitudes and tilt angles.Compare the behavior of the function at locations above and belowthe arctic circle."

1272,"Archive-name: space/netLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:15 $NETWORK RESOURCESOVERVIEW    You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of    computers, so much of the material below may not apply to you. In    general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to    special 'servers'.    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more    specialized mailing lists described below.    A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a    'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are    called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',    and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called    'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was    posted.    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make    it the preferred option.MAILING LISTS    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the    International Space University (in only its second change of management    in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body    should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note    that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of    a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are    available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve	julius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README    for further details.    Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle    Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line    elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources    as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.    GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning    System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to    gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.    Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in    space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.    Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics;    discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid    capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to    space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and    selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from    gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech,    or by email to space-tech-request if you don't have FTP access.    SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and    Development of Space and other interested parties. Email    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying ""SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your    name"". Email saying ""INDEX SEDS-L"" to list the archive contents.    SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status    reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in    Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET saying ""SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name"" to join.    Email saying ""INDEX SEDSNEWS"" to list the archive contents.    Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which    carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group. Email him    to join the list.    As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a    mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate    'please remove me from this list' messages which are sent to the list    address rather than the request address.PERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION    In addition to this FAQ list, a broad variety of topical information is    posted to the net (unless otherwise noted, in the new group    sci.space.news created for this purpose). Please remember that the    individuals posting this information are performing a service for all    net readers, and don't take up their time with frivolous requests.

1343,"Hi,	I have a few question about graphics programming in VGA/SVGA :1. How VESA standard works?  Any documentation for VESA standard?2. At a higher resolution than 320x200x256 or 640x480x16 VGA mode,   where the video memory A0000-AFFFF is no longer sufficient to hold   all info, what is the trick to do fast image manipulation?  I   heard about memory mapping or video memory bank switching but know   nothing on how it is implemented.   Any advice, anyone?  3. My interest is in 640x480x256 mode.  Should this mode be called   SVGA mode?  What is the technique for fast image scrolling for the   above mode?  How to deal with different SVGA cards?  Your guidance to books or any other sources to the above questionswould be greatly appreciated.  Please send me mail.

1385,"Moscow Scientific Inductrial Association ""Spectrum"" offer       VIDEOSCAN vision system for PC/AT,wich include software and set of       controllers.                     SOFTWARE            For support VIDEOSCAN family program kit was developed. Kit       includes more then 200 different functions for image processing.            Kit works in the interactive regime, and has include Help for       non professional users.            There are next possibility:       - input frame by any board of VIDEOSCAN family;       - read - white image to - from disk;       - print image on the printer;       - makes arithmetic with 2 frames;       - filter image;       - work with gistogramme;       - edit image.       - include users exe modules.                     CONTROLLER VS9       The function of VS-9 controller is to load TV-images into  PC/AT.       VS-9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV-frame from       a field of 724x600 pixels.       The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in       the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image. This       provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal       and vertical directions.       The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.       Video signal capture time - 2.5s.                     CONTROLLER VS52       The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM       PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was       created on the base of modern elements, including user       programmable gate arrays.       The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different       resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change       technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any       other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning       devices).       The controller has the following technical characteristics:       - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;       - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64       to 1024x512 pixels ;       - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024       pixels;       - video signal capture time - 40 ms.       - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024       pixels ;       - number of gray level - 256 ;       - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;       - 4 input video multiplexer ;       - input/output lookup table (LUT);       - possibility to realize ""scroll"" and ""zoom"";       - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external       controlling signal) ;       - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -       digital converter;       - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.       One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the       controller by reprogramming it.              IMAGE PROCESSOR VS100"

1438,"The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory,a 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from DimitriYushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERSnever led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked anNHL record 9th OT loss this season.Roster move:Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGillInjuries:Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.Lines:Eklund-Lindros-RecchiBeranek-Brind'Amour-DineenLomakin-Butsayev-ConroyFaust-Acton-BrownGalley-BowenYushkevich-HawgoodCarkner-HynesDominic RousselGame Summary:I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these partsI didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed bya few things I did pick up:First Period:	Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51	Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,Har (interference) 18:43Second Period:	Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00	Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09	Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Harmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50Third Period:	Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)	Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11	Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30Overtime:	Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.Penalties - NonePower Play:	Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4Goalies:	Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)	Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blueline and Nylander stripped him and took off.The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and itended up behind the goalie.On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and ifthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one ofthem was the closest FLYER to the play.That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who itwas that scored, much less how.From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hartasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of thegame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprisedthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a seasonand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi fornumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing betweenhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.The difference between the team's record with him and without him is noaccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful withoutRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with EricLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jerseynext season.#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn'tplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my familyhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that TommySoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains againabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single seasonscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single playerget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.Not a tough choice.Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point totalwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top linethis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get thedefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookiemistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feelingthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving upanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defensemanin years to come.Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are somethings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against hiswishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensivecontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own endwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.But consistency became a problem for him.A couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:Tom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mailaddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.If you're interested, you can send him mail at:att!ACR.ORG!TMISNIKThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winningpercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th inPatrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th innext years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored asmany goals as they allowed, 319.The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the HockeyNews that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I haveno other way of getting them.I hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have. Knowingthe future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more timealmost bearable.FLYERS team record watch:Eric Lindros:41 goals, 34 assists, 75 points(rookie records)club record goals:			club record points:Eric Lindros	40 1992-93		Dave Poulin	76 1983-84Brian Propp	34 1979-80		Brian Propp	75 1979-80Ron Flockhart	33 1981-82		Eric Lindros	75 1992-93Dave Poulin	31 1983-84		Ron Flockhart	72 1981-82Bill Barber	30 1972-73		Pelle Eklund	66 1985-86Mark Recchi:53 goals, 70 assists, 123 points.club record goals:			club record points:Reggie Leach	61 1975-76		Mark Recchi	123 1992-93*Tim Kerr	58 1985-86,86-87	Bobby Clarke	119 1975-76Tim Kerr	54 1983-84,84-85	Bobby Clarke	116 1974-75Mark Recchi	53 1992-93*		Bill Barber	112 1975-76Rick Macliesh	50 1972-73		Bobby Clarke	104 1972-73Bill Barber	50 1975-76		Rick Macliesh	100 1972-73Reggie Leach	50 1979-80*More than 80 games.FLYERS career years:Player		Points	Best Prior SeasonMark Recchi	123	113 (90-91 Penguins)Rod Brind'Amour	86	77 (91-92 FLYERS)Garry Galley	62	38 (84-85 Kings)Brent Fedyk	59	35 (90-91 Red Wings)That's all for now..."
1443,"   {Description of ""External Tank"" option for SSF redesign deleted}Yo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the ""External Tank"" and""Wingless Orbiter"" options have been deleted from the SSF redesignoptions list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reportsthat O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals havebeen dropped, such as using the ""giant external fuel tanks usedin launching space shuttles,"" and building a ""station aroundan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.""Currently, there are three options being considered, as presentedto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported intoday's Times).Option ""A"" - Low Cost Modular ApproachThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supportingthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC andReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respectiveteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of thisoption are:  -  Uses ""Bus-1"", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this     for the Air Force.  -  A ""Power Station Capability"" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle     flies in an ""arrow mode"" to optimize the microgravity environment.     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power     source for 30 day missions.  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and     add another 20 kW of power  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return     Vehicle).Option ""B"" - Space Station Freedom DerivedThe Option ""B"" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which wehave all come to know and love :)This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available foruse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option ""A""). Also, the number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,for both options ""A"" and ""B"".The build-up occurs in six phases:  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when     it visits.  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).  -  A ""Two Fault Tolerance Capability"" is achieved after 14 flights,     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the     assembly in 24 flights.Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, with the exception of the data management system, which has majorchanges."

If I forgot or botched yourfavorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there's an acronym *not*on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figureit out, I'll add it to the list.Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen*acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporatedevery acronym I ever saw, I'd soon run out of disk space!  :-)The list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  Allcomments regarding it are welcome; I'm reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on yourown for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number ofacronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms thatare essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted.Further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 ofthe list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simplydifferent ways of referring to the same thing.Thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version ofthe list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu),who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose incharacter than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de),who is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms andterms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASAReference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System andAssociated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a trulymammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.Special Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl programwritten by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble theacronym list in an entertaining fashion.

1592,"Sorry, Bryan, this is not quite correct. Remember the VGALIB package that comeswith Linux/SLS? It will switch to VGA 320x200x256 mode *without* Xwindows.So at least it is *possible* to write a GIF viewer under Linux. However I don'tthink that there exists a similar SVGA package, and viewing GIFs in 320x200 isnot very nice.Best Regards,Arno-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Arno Schaefer				ENSIMAG, 2e AnneeEmail: schaefer@silene.imag.frTel.: (33) 76 51 79 95			:-)"

1661,"Time to clear out some miscellaneous lenses, cameras and photo stuffthat's not being used.  Some are gems, some are mundane.  Minolta AF 50/1.7 lens for Maxxum cameras.

Pretty cute ""flip back""tang so it will work with all manual focus Nikon lenses - and bodies.It will even couple (and double) a non-AI lens to an AI body.  $15. Pentax 50/1.4 screwmount lens.  Well actually it's a Super-Takumar whichis what they all were back then.  Very mint condition.  $25. Nice hardcase for this lens $5 more.. Alpex 135/2.8 lens.  Beautifully made, all metal construction with fineoptics.  Minolta mount.  $25.  Another hard case that fits this withstrap can be added..call it $7 more. Vivitar 283 flash.  The one that made Vivitar famous (until the 285eclipsed it).  Tilt head, removable sensor, variable auto exposure.$30. Universal ""Roamer 63"" folding old ""bellows"" camera with leather case.Uses 120 or 620 film, 100mm F6.3 lens.  Kinda cool articulated shutterrelease.  Decent shape.  $20. Weston 540 lightmeter.  Nothin super fancy, but it works well, and is agood cross check to built in meters.  $7 with case and strap. And finally..the ""gems"" Pentax Auto 110 camera with 24mm F2.8 lens.  This is the little(and I do mean TINY) SLR that Pentax made.  Has interchangeable lenses,but try and find the 20-40 zoom, true through the lens viewing withsplit image focus, and completely auto exposure.  $70. Olympus 35RC rangefinder camera.  A really cute little camera with 42mmlens (F2.8) with built in manual or auto exposure, self timer etc.  Ithink this was the predecessor to the XA - and it's nearly all metal.I won't mind holding onto this one if it doesn't sell.  $60. Olympus OM-1 with flash shoe, leatherette case, 50/1.4 Zuiko lens, andTokina SD (Super Dispersion) 70-210 lens.  These are all in very nice tomint condition, except for one little ding on the OM body near the filmadvance lever.  Lenses are perfect, and the Tokina is a very compact,and sharp lens.  $225 for the set.  That'll do to clean out some of the stuff.

1669,"There is another useful method based on Least Sqyares Estimation of the sphere equation parameters.The points (x,y,z) on a spherical surface with radius R and center (a,b,c) can be written as    (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = R^2This equation can be rewritten into the following form:     2ax + 2by + 2cz + R^2 - a^2 - b^2 -c^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2Approximate the left hand part by   F(x,y,z) = p1.x + p2.x + p3.z + p4.1For all datapoints, i.c. 4, determine the 4 parameters p1..p4 which minimise the average error |F(x,y,z) - x^2 - y^2 - z^2|^2.In 'Numerical Recipes in C' can be found algorithms to solve these parameters.The best fitting sphere will have - center (a,b,c) = (p1/2, p2/2, p3/2)- radius R = sqrt(p4 + a.a + b.b + c.c).So, at last, will this solve you sphere estination problem, at least for the most situations I think ?."

Ville Siren's slap shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period. The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then, during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47. Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund  skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3. Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since there was traffic in front, 4-3. Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan ""the Shadow"" Nilsson. Stefan and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3. Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone  with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot. The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot, showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side. But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved. All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best. Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period to try no combinations. Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson- Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line. Stillman good on defense. Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson will likely have to leave for NHL pros. Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC. I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter- resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Starting lines: 	SWEDEN					FINLAND  35.

1837,"To All -- I thought the net would find this amusing..  From the March 1993 ""Aero Vision"" (The newsletter for the Employeesof McDonnell Douglas Aerospace at Huntington Beach, California).    SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY    ""On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.  launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.  The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and  SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed  Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force  Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for  potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were  successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria  and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the  cafeteria.    Quest's Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the  McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the  McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude  of 300 feet.  The Space Clippers can be used in educational  settings to teach mathematics and science, as well as social  studies and other applications.  The Space Clipper is available  either in the $35 Space Clipper outfit, which includes everything  needed for three launches, or as individual rockets for $12 each.  Both are available through hobby shops or by calling 1-800-858-  7302.""  By the way -- this is not an endorsement to buy the product nor isit an advertisement to buy the product.

(Why?Because it's Monday and I didn't feel like writing any REAL code...)Anyway, after I wiped out the 60-odd goalies in the list, I came up with:NHL average:		55 GP      11 G      19 A      30 Pts      69 PIMThen I passed the list through a second time to come up with the players whohad the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories.Marty McInnis (NYI)	56 GP (1%) 10 G (9%) 20 A (5%) 30 Pts (0%) 24 PIM (65%)Igor Kravchuk (EDM)	55 GP (0%) 10 G (9%) 17 A (10%) 27 Pts (9%) 27 PIM (53%)These two are close in games, goals, assists, and points, but are too far offin PIM. This leaves, as the most average player in the NHL:Bobby Carpenter (WAS)	65 GP (18%) 11 G (0%) 17 A (10%) 28 Pts (6%) 63 PIM (8%)What an honor.I also passed the list through with the goalies still included. Kravchuk andCarpenter were still in the top three, but Rob DiMaio came flying up from behind to take the title:NHL average:		53 GP      10 G      17 A      27 Pts      64 PIMIgor Kravchuk (EDM)     55 GP (3%) 10 G (0%) 17 A (0%) 27 Pts (0%) 27 PIM (50%)Bobby Carpenter (WAS)   65 GP (22%) 11 G (10%) 17 A (0%) 28 Pts (3%) 63 PIM (1%)Rob DiMaio (TB)		54 GP (1%) 9 G (9%) 15 A (11%) 24 Pts (11%) 62 PIM (3%)It's all really kind of underwhelming when you think about it.-SG"

Thanks!=================================================================        REQUEST FOR IDEAS FOR APPLICATIONS OF REMOTE SENSING DATABASES                              VIA THE INTERNET NASA is planning to expand the domain of users of its Earth and space sciencedata.  This effort will:   o   Use the evolving infrastructure of the U.S. Global Change Research       Program including the Mission To Planet Earth (MTPE) and the Earth       Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Programs.   o   Use the Internet, particularly the High Performance Computing and       Communications Program's NREN (National Research and Education       Network), as a means of providing access to and distribution of       science data and images and value added products.   o   Provide broad access to and utilization of remotely sensed images in       cooperation with other agencies (especially NOAA, EPA, DOE, DEd,       DOI/USGS, and USDA).    o   Support remote sensing image and data users and development       communities.  The user and development communities to be included (but not limited to) aspart of this effort are educators, commercial application developers (e.g., television weather forecasters), librarians, publishers, agriculture specialists, transportation, forestry, state and local government planners, andaqua business. This program will be initiated in 1994.  Your assistance is requested to identify potential applications of remote sensing images and data.  We would like your ideas for potential application areas to assist with development ofthe Implementation Plan. PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.   We are seeking your ideas in these areas:    (1)  Potential commercial use of remote sensing data and images;    (2)  Potential noncommercial use of remote sensing data and images in        education (especially levels K-12) and other noncommercial areas;   (3)  Types of on-line capabilities and protocols to make the data more        accessible;   (4)  Additional points of contacts for ideas; and    (5)  Addresses and names  from whom to request proposals.  For your convenience, a standard format for responses is included below.  Feelfree to amend it as necessary.  Either e-mail or fax your responses to us byMay 5, 1993.

1882,"Archive-name: space/introLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:10 $    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO    INTRODUCTION    This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenetgroups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers tofrequently asked questions and other reference material which is worthpreserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently askedquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email toleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).    If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' toyour KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreaderthat can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed downby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available inthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. Thepoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing oldanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressingthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are providedbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.    Questions fall into three basic types:    1) Where do I find some information about space?    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended    discussion.    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?    Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.    3) Miscellanous queries.    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of    FAQ postings.    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE    Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]    Edit ""Subject:"" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth	100 posts).    Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST	not SPACE.    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all	references.)    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're	responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail	or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the	'reply' function of mailers will work.    Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone	will get on TV anyway.    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:	keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals	(use carriage returns).

1945,"Visual Numerics Inc. (formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in theprocess of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0 and C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C ExponentGraphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through June 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with ansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge tape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products. X Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts: 1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types   available through a large collection of X resources.2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers.3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization.4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback.5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget    library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar    to X programmers.6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge's UIM/X product.   This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical   layout of an application. C Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts: 1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library   is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C   standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C.2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse    interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control   with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization.3. Large collection of high-level application functions for ""two-call""   graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available   with minimal programming effort.4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling   the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot   the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can    control the event loop. If anyone is interested in beta testing either of the products, pleasecontact Wendy Hou at Visual Numerics via email at hou@imsl.com or call713-279-1066.  -- Jaclyn Brandtjbrandt@NeoSoft.com"

If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the  Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from  the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with  searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]  Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)  The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries  in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360  array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for  every half degree longitude and latitude.   A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as  polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask  Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.  (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to  compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.NCAR data---------  NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of  terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at  various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.  This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending  on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,  IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive  is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,  email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.UNC data tapes with voxel data--------------  There are 2 ""public domain"" tapes with data for the comparison and  testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT  scans).

Background imagery/textures/datafiles========================================= First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTPlist above.24-bit scanning:----------------  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll  house supplies.  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.Books with textures:--------------------  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also  a wide variety of stock art is available.  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your  graphics work. Their address is:	Edition Belvedere Co.

Introduction to rendering algorithms========================================a. Ray-Tracing:---------------  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would  suggest:   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines  (erich@eye.com)There's a more concise reference also:  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: ""An Introduction to Ray Tracing"", in  ""Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD"", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)--------------------------A good reference is:        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.c.

Where can I find the geometric data for the:================================================a. Teapot ?-----------""Displays on Display"" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the wholestory about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also hasthe bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframemodel of the teapot.IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column ""Jim Blinn's Corner"" describesan another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations forexample are used.The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to getthem to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles ata specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs atessellation at any specified resolution.b. Space Shuttle ?------------------Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttledatafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):model1:A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).Payload doors non-existent.Units: unknown.Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy.

Image annotation software=============================a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a  rasterfile.b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not  sure exactly what they are.  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not  be redistributed without permission.  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the   position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen   color from a pull-down menu.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,  synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.  WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their  imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware  developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their  own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers  (specialized hardware).

This was  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a  freebie if you want it""  ""My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets   comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,   menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability   of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an   encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap   manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only   color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets   developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget   set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers   using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other   Motif widgets.  FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)   simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these  simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these  data graphically.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)===================================================GRASS-----  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,  although it is reported to have significant image processing  capabilities.  Feature Descriptions  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software."" A first review  of  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68  Host Configuration Requirements  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented  in raster (grid-cell) form.  Availability  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.  This location will be the new ""canonical"" source for GRASS software, as  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and  ""tar"" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu  Support  Listserv mailing lists:  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.Microstation Imager-------------------  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.  Feature Description  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available  for GIS applications.  Host Configuration Requirements  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.PCI---  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of  remote sensing data in eight or ten different ""industry standard""  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.  The ""PCI software"" consists of several classes/groups/packages of  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common ""PCI  database"" disk file.  The ""Tape I/O"" package is a set of utility  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the ""PCI database"" file;  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.  ""multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5""), and  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your  particular application/interest calls for.  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight ""parameters,"" read from  a common ""parameter file"" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your ""default  directory.""  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI  data structures (database file, parameter file).  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the  Macintosh calls ""raw"") data from tape, in a number of different  ""interleave"" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the  graphic-arts industry's ""CT2T"" format, would probably (I haven't tried)  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI ""database"" file is designed to  contain not only ""raster"" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this  can go into the PCI ""database"").  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would  display directly from a PCI ""database"" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be ""overkill""  in your case; it seems designed for the very ""high end""  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these  areas.SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)--------------------------------  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X  for display.MAP II------  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.CLRview-------  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129)   in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

[*]Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-codedfor a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slopeof 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).I've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried thisbefore, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran apacked->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the ""jaggies.""  I'mnow considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distortthe original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise shearedshape?Currently I take:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64and produce:                         1  2  3  433 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  849 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32                                    61 62 63 64Line 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1.Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3.This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  Butit causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way?Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmapalready skewed?Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective?I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering.Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.[*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)*are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears tobe an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outsideof a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have tochange size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that thisapproximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enoughdistance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object ina real perspective drawing.Hopefully the ""context"" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torcheshanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.Thanks in advance for any help."

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD   On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co-inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D.Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell ScienceCenter in Thousand Oaks, CA.   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in SpaceMaterials Processing with the Space Systems Division of RockwellInternational in Downey, California.  He is a recognized worldauthority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written orcoauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrialmaterials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. DavidCriswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legalexperts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to buildthe Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with apotential to power the globe.   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly halffrom California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientificconcept of a solar power system based on the Moon.   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunarsurface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmittedthrough orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormoussource of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's everincreasing demand using proven, basic technology.

Both teams seemed a bit tense in theopening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings gotinto the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out-standing team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to recordtheir first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams onpenalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings hadtheir problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10tries.The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at theblue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horsein his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.1st period: 1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky wonthe draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped thepuck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to thefar side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. Heput the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set upin 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle whereSydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the hash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.Millen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kingsfailed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.Dahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30second 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts inthe period.2nd period: The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failedto convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck intothe stands and received a delay of game.1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with thepuck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle andskated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him and he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.Shuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headedfor the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carsoncame from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shotbetween the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked offthe puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a passcross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,beating a diving Vernon on the glove side.4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form thenear point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got hisown rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the lowslot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.Skrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but theyfailed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutivepower plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for highsticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  TheKings hit 3 goal post in the period.3rd period:The Kings used the phrase ""Initiate, not retaliate"" and it was very evident herein the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shotthe puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net tocut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to thecrease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the netwhere Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.Sydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the netand passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleurytripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at 8:19) took penalties.  5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near point, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards thenet, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove ofHrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power playto seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, beating Vernon on the ice, stick side.At the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as hewent after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a singleminor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flamesright out of the game.On the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockeyas they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellentpenalty killing.On the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve orthe Flames will surely get that power play back on track.Notes:------The Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, givingthe opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon games.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power playover their last 9 games.The teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.Playoffs:Campbell Conference:Smythe Division:LA  6  @ CAL 3 		LA leads 1-0WIN    @ VANNorris Division:STL 4  @ CHI 3		STL leads 1-0TOR    @ DETWales Conference:Adams Division:BUF 5  @ BOS 4 (OT)	BUF leads 1-0MON 2  @ QUE 3 (OT)	QUE leads 1-0Patrick Division:NJ  3  @ PIT 6		PIT leads 1-0NYI 1  @ WAS 3		WAS leads 1-0Records:--------vs	Smythe	 Norris	 Patrck	Adams	Overall================================================Home:    0- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    0- 0-0 Road:    1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    1- 0-0==============================================================Total:   1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0	0-0-0	 1- 0-0  Box Score:=========================Calgary      0 1 2 - 3Los Angeles  1 3 2 - 6=========================1st period: LA  Sydor 1 (Gretzky, Sandstrom), 0:16    LA  Millen - high sticking, 4:57    CAL Fleury - high sticking, 4:57    CAL Skrudland - interference, 12:25    LA  Carson - tripping 14:53    CAL Dahlquist - holding stick, 18:34    CAL Dahl - roughing 19:302nd period:     CAL Verson - delay of game (served by Ashton), 1:34CAL Suter 1 (Fleury), 2:48 (sh)LA  Carson 1 (Shuchuk, Sydor), 3:13 (pp)LA  Huddy 1 (Taylor, Rychel), 3:37LA  McSorley 1 (unassisted), 6:36    CAL Skrudland - elbowing, 10:53    LA  Sydor - tripping, 12:35    LA  Watters- hooking, 14:40    LA  McSorley - holding, 17:19    CAL Suter - high sticking, 17:31    LA  Sandstrom - hooking, 18:033rd period:LA  Millen 1 (Granato, Donnelly), 1:06    LA Sydor - hooking, 1:24    CAL Nieuwendyk - tripping, 3:22CAL Dahlquist 1 (Otto), 4:23    CAL Fleury - major (boarding), game misconduct, 6:08    LA  Granato - tripping, 6:44    LA  Watters - interference, 8:19CAL Yawney 1 (MacInnis, Reichel), 8:47    CAL MacInnis - roughing, 9:56LA  Carson 2 (Sandstrom, Robitaille), 10:32 (pp)    LA  Hardy - holding, 11:38    CAL Skrudland - slashing, 16:17    CAL Stern - double roughing, cross-checking, 10 min. misconduct, 16:17Overtime: noneShots:------Los Angeles   8  9 14 - 31Calgary       5  8 11 - 24Power play conversions:-----------------------For:      2 of 10; for the year:  2 of  10,  20.00%Against:  0 of  8; for the year:  8 of   8, 100.00%Goalies:--------Los Angeles - Hrudey (1-0-0)Calgary - Vernon (0-1-0)Attendance: 18,605Scratches:----------Rob Blake - back contusionGuy Leveque - numbersLonnie Loach - numbersMarc Potvin - numbersBrandy Semchuk - numbersRobb Stauber - numbersBrent Thompson - numbersJim Thomson - numbersLines - Forwards:----------------*Robitaille - Gretzky - Sandstrom Donnelly - Millen - KurriRychel - Conacher - TaylorGranato - Carson - ShuchukLines - Defense:----------------*Huddy - SydorWatters - ZhitnikHardy - McSorley* denotes starting lineupNext game:----------Wednesday, April 21 @ Calgary Flames; 6:30pm Pacific Time on Prime Ticket===============================================================================Stan Willis (willis@empire.dnet.hac.com)net contact: L.A.

2273,"I have posted a DOS MPEG decoder/player to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities.Here is a short description and some technical information, taken from theaccompanying documentation:                              DMPEG V1.0                       Public Domain MPEG decoder                           by Stefan Eckart0. Features===========DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC: - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported) - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA) - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale - color-space selection - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic) - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for   VGA and many Super-VGAs...4. Technical information========================The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2](not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zerocoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Maindifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supportedalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option touse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturationdominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality ofthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributedover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space pointsis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at theexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lyingsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximatedby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead ofconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to thelower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes thanto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improveon NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redishareas...."

Many of thesemail servers have a command like   path a_valid_return_e-mail_addressto get a hint for sending back to you stuff.DEC's FTPMAIL-------------  Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,  and having a line containing the word 'help'.  You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you  must follow in order to get the files you want.  Note that the ""reply"" or ""answer"" command in your mailer will not work  for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send  requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.  Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com  address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not  responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.BITFTP------  For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.

The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding Ranford. Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom  played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge to Sweden in creating more opportunities. Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada. The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out. Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1. Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal. At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it. That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in  the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal. Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods. The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds in the dressing room. A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best goalie in the world, were some comments after the game. Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well, Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals. The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin- Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well. Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake on the 1-3 goal. Lines information follows further below.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ITALY - SWITZERLAND  1-0 (0-0,1-0,0-0) 1st: 2nd: ITA 1-0 Orlando          15:47 3rd: Penalties: ITA 10*2min, SWI 8*2min Referee: Anton Danko, Slovakia Attendance: 3,500------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Group B results: CZECH REPUBLIC - GERMANY  5-0 (0-0,3-0,2-0) 1st: 2nd: CZE 1-0 Kamil Kastak        1:51      CZE 2-0 Jiri Dolezal       12:26      CZE 3-0 Petr Hrbek         19:10 3rd: CZE 4-0 Radek Toupal        8:28      CZE 5-0 Josef Beranek      17:07 Penalties: CZE 7*2min, GER 6*2min 1*5min 1*10min game penalty Referee: Darren Loraas, Canada Attendance: 10,200 The Czechs were clearly better than the Germans, and the German crowd showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - FINLAND - USA  1-1 (0-0,1-0,0-1) 1st: 2nd: FIN 1-0 Jarkko Varvio      4:00 3rd: USA 1-1 Ed Olczyk          4:26 Penalties: FIN 7*2min, USA 6*2min Referee: Valeri Bokarev, Russia Attendance: 2,800 I hope some Finns can provide information from this game (I didn't see the whole game). The Finns took the lead on a Jarkko Varvio slap shot from the blue line, and a soft goal for an unscreened Mike Richter. As far as the play in the second period goes, the Finns seemed to have the most control, so a 1-0 lead was warranted as I saw it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------		   SWEDEN			   CANADA Goaltender:	30 Tommy Soderstrom		30 Bill Ranford Defense:	 8 Kenneth Kennholt		 5 Norm Maciver		14 Fredrik Stillman		24 Dave Manson		 3 Peter Popovic		25 Geoff Smith		55 Peter Andersson		19 Brian Benning		 7 Arto Blomsten		 6 Terry Carkner		28 Roger Akerstrom		 3 Garry Galley						 4 Derek Mayer Forwards:	29 Mikael Renberg		15 Dave Gagner		 9 Thomas Rundqvist		27 Adam Graves		34 Mikael Andersson		22 Mike Gartner		19 Markus Naslund		20 Paul Kariya		21 Peter Forsberg		88 Eric Lindros		18 Jonas Bergqvist		 8 Mark Recchi		 5 Patrik Juhlin		17 Rod Brind'Amour		20 Jan Larsson			 9 Shayne Corson		 4 Stefan Nilsson		11 Kevin Dineen		22 Charles Berglund		10 Geoff Sanderson		26 Michael Nylander		12 Greg Johnson		(34 Andersson/18 Bergqvist)	14 Brian Savage						16 Kelly Buchberger"
